It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.","No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another.","We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it.","So don't let anyone tell you that change is not possible. Don't let them tell you that standing out and speaking up about injustice is too risky. What's too risky is keeping quiet. What's too risky is looking the other way.","Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law--for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.","I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.","It is easier to start wars than to end them.","I guarantee you we will move this country forward. We will finish what we started. And we'll remind the world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.","We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and strengthen our union once more.","It's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.","What Washington needs is adult supervision.","If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.","My job is not to represent Washington to you, but to represent you to Washington.","Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.","Hope&mdash;Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation.","If we aren't willing to pay a price for our values, then we should ask ourselves whether we truly believe in them at all.","Yes, we can. Yes, we can change. Yes, we can.","And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear ... we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the American people in three simple words&mdash;yes, we

He was elected to the U.S. presidency in 2008, and won re-election in 2012 against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Barack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Ann-Dunham-434238\">Ann Dunham<\/a>, was born on an Army base in Wichita, Kansas, during World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dunham's father, Stanley, enlisted in the military and marched across Europe in <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-patton-9434904\">General George Patton<\/a>'s army. Dunham's mother, Madelyn, went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, the couple studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through the Federal Housing Program and, after several moves, ended up in Hawaii.<\/p><div tml-collection=\"ci01d0897830002a83\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-render-style=\"slideshow\">\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n<\/div> <p>Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., was born of Luo ethnicity in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama Sr. grew up herding goats in Africa and, eventually earned a scholarship that allowed him to leave Kenya and pursue his dreams of going to college in Hawaii. While studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Obama Sr. met fellow student Ann Dunham, and they married on February 2, 1961. Barack was born six months later.<\/p> <p>As a child, Obama did not have a relationship with his father. When his son was still an infant, Obama Sr. relocated to Massachusetts to attend Harvard University and pursue a Ph.D. Obama's parents officially separated several months later and ultimately divorced in March 1964, when their son was two. Soon after, Obama Sr. returned to Kenya.<\/p> <p>In 1965, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, a University of Hawaii student from Indonesia. A year later, the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama's half-sister, Maya Soetoro Ng, was born in 1970. Several incidents in Indonesia left Dunham afraid for her son's safety and education so, at the age of 10, Obama was sent back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. His mother and half-sister later joined them.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"education\"><h2>Education<\/h2><p>While living with his grandparents, Obama enrolled in the esteemed Punahou Academy, He excelled in basketball and graduated with academic honors in 1979. As one of only three black students at the school, Obama became conscious of racism and what it meant to be African-American. He later described how he struggled to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage with his own sense of self: \"I noticed that there was nobody like me in the Sears, Roebuck Christmas catalog. . .and that Santa was a white man,\" he wrote. \"I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror with all my senses and limbs seemingly intact, looking as I had always looked, and wondered if something was wrong with me.\"<\/p> <p>Obama also struggled with the absence of his father, who he saw only once more after his parents divorced, when Obama Sr. visited Hawaii for a short time in 1971. \"[My father] had left paradise, and nothing that my mother or grandparents told me could obviate that single, unassailable fact,\" he later reflected. \"They couldn't describe what it might have been like had he stayed.\"<\/p> <p>Ten years later, in 1981, tragedy struck Obama Sr. when he lost both of his legs in a serious car accident. Confined to a wheelchair, he also lost his job. In 1982, Obama Sr. was involved in yet another car accident while traveling in Nairobi. This time, however, the crash was fatal. Obama Sr. died on November 24, 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. \"At the time of his death, my father remained a myth to me,\" Obama later wrote, \"both more and less than a man.\"<\/p> <p>After high school, Obama studied at Occidental College in Los Angeles for two years. He then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, graduating in 1983 with a degree in political science. After working in the business sector for two years, Obama moved to Chicago in 1985. There, he worked on the impoverished South Side as a community organizer for low-income residents in the Roseland and the Altgeld Gardens communities.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"law-career\"><h2>Law Career<\/h2><p>It was during this time that Obama, who said he \"was not raised in a religious household,\" joined the Trinity United Church of Christ. He also visited relatives in Kenya, and paid an emotional visit to the graves of his biological father and paternal grandfather. \"For a long time I sat between the two graves and wept,\" Obama wrote. \"I saw that my life in America—the black life, the white life, the sense of abandonment I'd felt as a boy, the frustration and hope I'd witnessed in Chicago—all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away.\"<\/p> <p>Returning from Kenya with a sense of renewal, Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988. The next year, he met with constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe and their discussion so impressed Tribe, that when Obama asked to join his team as a research assistant, the professor agreed. “The better he did at Harvard Law School and the more he impressed people, the more obvious it became that he could have had anything, said Professor Tribe in a 2012 <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/choice-2012/the-frontline-interview-laurence-tribe/\">interview with <em>Frontline<\/em><\/a><em><\/em>, “but it was clear that he wanted to make a difference to people, to communities.” That same year Obama joined the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin as a summer associate and it was there he met <a href=\"/people/michelle-obama-307592\">Michelle Robinson<\/a>, a young lawyer who was assigned to be his adviser.&nbsp;Not long after, the couple began dating. In February 1990, Obama was elected the first African-American editor of the <em>Harvard Law Review<\/em>. He graduated&nbsp;magna cum laude&nbsp;from Harvard Law in 1991.<\/p> <p>After law school, Obama returned to Chicago to practice as a civil rights lawyer with the firm of Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland. He also taught constitutional law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004—first as a lecturer and then as a professor—and helped organize voter registration drives during <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Bill-Clinton-9251236\">Bill Clinton<\/a>'s 1992 presidential campaign. On October 3, 1992, he and Michelle were married. They moved to Kenwood, on Chicago's South Side, and welcomed two daughters several years later: Malia (born 1998) and Sasha (born 2001).<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"entry-into-illinois-politics\"><h2>Entry Into Illinois Politics<\/h2><p>Obama published an autobiography, <em>Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance<\/em>, in 1995. The work received high praise from literary figures such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/toni-morrison-9415590\">Toni Morrison<\/a> and has since been printed in more than 25 languages, including Chinese, Swedish and Hebrew. The book had a second printing in 2004 and was adapted for a children's version. The audiobook version of <em>Dreams<\/em>, narrated by Obama, received a Grammy Award for best spoken word album in 2006.<\/p> <p>Obama's advocacy work led him to run for a seat in the Illinois State Senate. He ran as a Democrat and won election in 1996. During his years as a state senator, Obama worked with both Democrats and Republicans to draft legislation on ethics, as well as expand health care services and early childhood education programs for the poor. He also created a state earned-income tax credit for the working poor. As chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases after a number of death-row inmates were found to be innocent.<\/p> <p>In 2000, Obama made an unsuccessful Democratic primary run for the U.S. House of Representatives seat held by four-term incumbent candidate Bobby Rush. Undeterred, he created a campaign committee in 2002 and began raising funds to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2004. With the help of political consultant <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/David-Axelrod-431900\">David Axelrod<\/a>, Obama began assessing his prospects for a Senate win.<\/p> <p>Following the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Obama was an early opponent of President <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/George-W.-Bush-9232768\">George W. Bush<\/a>'s push to go to war with Iraq. Obama was still a state senator when he spoke against a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq during a rally at Chicago's Federal Plaza in October 2002. \"I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars,\" he said. \"What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Paul-Wolfowitz-40390\">Paul Wolfowitz<\/a> and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.\" Despite his protests, the Iraq War began in 2003.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"us-senate-career\"><h2>U.S. Senate Career<\/h2><p>Encouraged by poll numbers, Obama decided to run for the U.S. Senate open seat vacated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald. In the 2004 Democratic primary, he defeated multimillionaire businessman Blair Hull and Illinois Comptroller Daniel Hynes with&nbsp;52 percent of the vote. That summer, he was invited to deliver the keynote speech in support of <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/John-Kerry-10673562\">John Kerry<\/a> at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Obama emphasized the importance of unity and made veiled jabs at the Bush administration and the diversionary use of wedge issues.<\/p> <p>After the convention, Obama returned to his U.S. Senate bid in Illinois. His opponent in the general election was supposed to be Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, a wealthy former investment banker. However, Ryan withdrew from the race in June 2004 following public disclosure of unsubstantiated sexual deviancy allegations by his ex-wife, actress Jeri Ryan.<\/p> <p>In August 2004, diplomat and former presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Alan-Keyes-39122\">Alan Keyes<\/a> accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In three televised debates, Obama and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Alan-Keyes-39122\">Keyes<\/a> expressed opposing views on stem cell research, abortion, gun control, school vouchers and tax cuts. In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70 percent of the vote to Keyes' 27 percent, the largest electoral victory in Illinois history. With his win, Obama became only the third African-American elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction.<\/p> <p>Sworn into office on January 3, 2005, Obama partnered with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana on a bill that expanded efforts to destroy weapons of mass destruction in Eastern Europe and Russia. Then, with Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, he created a website to track all federal spending. Obama also spoke out for victims of Hurricane Katrina, pushed for alternative energy development and championed improved veterans' benefits.<\/p> <p>His second book, <em>The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream<\/em>, was published in October 2006. The work discussed Obama's visions for the future of America, many of which became talking points for his eventual presidential campaign. Shortly after its release, the book hit No. 1 on both the <em>New York Times<\/em> and Amazon.com best-seller lists.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"2008-presidential-election\"><h2>2008 Presidential Election<\/h2><p>In February 2007, Obama made headlines when he announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. He was locked in a tight battle with former first lady and then-U.S. senator from New York <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton-9251306\">Hillary Rodham Clinton<\/a>. On June 3, 2008, Obama became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee after winning a sufficient number of pledged delegates during the primaries, and Clinton delivered her full support to Obama for the duration of his campaign. On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama defeated Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/articles/John-McCain-9542249\">John McCain<\/a>, 52.9 percent to 45.7 percent, to win election as the 44th president of the United States—and the first African-American to hold this office. His running mate, Delaware Senator Joe Biden, became vice president. Obama's inauguration took place on January 20, 2009.<\/p> <p>When Obama took office, he inherited a global economic recession, two ongoing foreign wars and the lowest-ever international favorability rating for the United States. He campaigned on an ambitious agenda of financial reform, alternative energy and reinventing education and health care—all while bringing down the national debt. Because these issues were intertwined with the economic well-being of the nation, he believed all would have to be undertaken simultaneously. During his inauguration speech, Obama summarized the situation by saying, \"Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.\"<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"first-100-days\"><h2>First 100 Days<\/h2><p>Between Inauguration Day and April 29, 2009, the Obama administration took action on many fronts. Obama coaxed Congress to expand health care insurance for children and provide legal protection for women seeking equal pay. A $787 billion stimulus bill was passed to promote short-term economic growth. Housing and credit markets were put on life support, with a market-based plan to buy U.S. banks' toxic assets. Loans were made to the auto industry, and new regulations were proposed for Wall Street. Obama also cut taxes for working families, small businesses and first-time home buyers. The president also loosened the ban on embryonic stem cell research and moved ahead with a $3.5 trillion budget plan.<\/p> <p>Over his first 100 days in office, President Obama also undertook a complete overhaul of America's foreign policy. He reached out to improve relations with Europe, China and Russia and to open dialogue with Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. He lobbied allies to support a global economic stimulus package. He committed an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan and set an August 2010 date for withdrawal of nearly all U.S. troops from Iraq. In more dramatic incidents, he ordered an attack on pirates off the coast of Somalia and prepared the nation for a swine flu outbreak. He signed an executive order banning excessive interrogation techniques and ordered the closing of the military detention facility at Cuba’s Guantanamo Bay within a year (a deadline that ultimately would not be met). For his efforts, the Nobel Committee in Norway awarded Obama the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"2010-state-of-the-union\"><h2>2010 State of the Union<\/h2><p>On January 27, 2010, President Obama delivered his first State of the Union speech. During his oration, Obama addressed the challenges of the economy, proposed a fee for larger banks, announced a possible freeze on government spending in the following fiscal year and spoke against the Supreme Court's reversal of a law capping campaign finance spending. He also challenged politicians to stop thinking of re-election and start making positive changes. He criticized Republicans for their refusal to support any legislation and chastised Democrats for not pushing hard enough to get legislation passed. He also insisted that, despite obstacles, he was determined to help American citizens through the nation's current domestic difficulties. \"We don't quit. I don't quit,\" he said. \"Let's seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.\"<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"challenges-and-successes\"><h2>Challenges and Successes<\/h2><p>In the second part of his first term as president, Obama faced a number of obstacles and scored some victories as well. In spite of opposition from Congressional Republicans and the populist Tea Party movement, Obama signed his health care reform plan, known as the Affordable Care Act, into law in March 2010. The new law prohibited the denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions, allowed citizens under 26 years old to be insured under parental plans, provided for free health screenings for certain citizens and expanded insurance coverage and access to medical care to millions of Americans. Opponents of the Affordable Care Act, which foes dubbed \"Obamacare,\" asserted that it added new costs to the country's overblown budget, violated the Constitution with its requirement for individuals to obtain insurance and amounted to a “government takeover” of health care<\/p> <p>On the economic front, Obama worked to steer the country through difficult financial times. After drawn-out negotiations with Republicans who gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2010 mid-term elections, he signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 in an effort to rein in government spending and prevent the government from defaulting on its financial obligations. The act also called for the creation of a bipartisan committee to seek solutions to the country's fiscal issues, but the group failed to reach any agreement on how to solve these problems.<\/p> <p>Also in 2011, Obama signed a repeal of the military policy known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" which prevented openly gay troops from serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. In March 2011, he approved U.S. participation in NATO airstrikes to support rebels fighting against the forces of Libyan dictator <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/muammar-al-qaddafi-39014\">Muammar al-Qaddafi<\/a>, and in May he also gave the green light to a covert operation in Pakistan that led to the killing of infamous al-Qaeda leader <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/osama-bin-laden-37172\">Osama bin Laden<\/a> by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Obama gained a legal victory in June 2012 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which required citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a tax. In a 5-4 decision, the court decided the health care law’s signature provision fell within the taxation power granted to Congress under the Constitution. Voting with the majority were two associate justices appointed by Obama—<a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/sonia-sotomayor-453906\">Sonia Sotomayor <\/a>(confirmed in 2009) and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/elena-kagan-560228\">Elena Kagan <\/a>(confirmed in 2010).<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"re-election-and-second-term\"><h2>2012 Re-Election<\/h2><p>As he did in 2008, during his campaign for a second presidential term, Obama focused on grassroots initiatives. Celebrities such as <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/anna-wintour-214147\">Anna Wintour<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/sarah-jessica-parker-9542042\">Sarah Jessica Parker<\/a> aided the president's campaign by hosting fund-raising events.<\/p> <p>\"I guarantee you, we will move this country forward,\" Obama stated in June 2012, at a campaign event in Maryland. \"We will finish what we started. And we'll remind the world just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.\"<\/p> <p>In the 2012 election, Obama faced Republican opponent <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/mitt-romney-241055\">Mitt Romney <\/a>and Romney's vice-presidential running mate, U.S. Representative <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/paul-ryan-20828085\">Paul Ryan<\/a>. On November 6, 2012, Obama won a second four-year term as president by receiving nearly five million more votes than Romney and capturing more than 60 percent of the Electoral College.<\/p> <p>Nearly one month after President Obama's re-election, the nation endured one of its most tragic school shootings to date when 20 children and six adults were shot to death at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. Two days after the attack, Obama delivered a speech at an interfaith vigil for the victims in Newtown and discussed a need for change in order to make schools safer while alluding to implementing stricter gun-control measures. \"These tragedies must end,\" Obama stated. \"In the coming weeks, I'll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens—from law enforcement, to mental-health professionals, to parents and educators—in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have? We can't accept events like these as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?\"<\/p> <p>Obama achieved a major legislative victory on January 1, 2013, when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved a bipartisan agreement on tax increases and spending cuts, in an effort to avoid the looming fiscal cliff crisis (the Senate voted in favor of the bill earlier that day). The agreement marked a productive first step toward the president's re-election promise of reducing the federal deficit by raising taxes on the extremely wealthy—individuals earning more than $400,000 per year and couples earning more than $450,000, according to the bill. Prior to the bill's passage, in late 2012, tense negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over spending cuts and tax increases became a bitter political battle until Vice President Joe Biden managed to hammer out a deal with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Obama pledged to sign the bill into law.<\/p><h2>Second Term<\/h2> <p>Barack Obama officially began his second term on January 21, 2013, when U.S. Chief Justice <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/john-roberts-20681147\">John Roberts<\/a> administered the oath of office. The inauguration was held on <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/martin-luther-king-jr-9365086\">Martin Luther King Jr. <\/a>Day, and civil-rights activist <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/myrlie-evers-williams-205624\">Myrlie Evers-Williams<\/a>, the widow of <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/medgar-evers-9542324\">Medgar Evers<\/a>, gave the invocation. <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/james-taylor-9503115\">James Taylor<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/beyonce-knowles-39230\">Beyoncé Knowles <\/a>and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/kelly-clarkson-9542602\">Kelly Clarkson<\/a> sang at the ceremony, and poet <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/richard-blanco-21104655\">Richard Blanco<\/a> read his poem \"One Today.\"&nbsp;<\/p> <p>In his inaugural address, Obama called the nation to action on such issues as climate change, health care and marriage equality. \"We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today's victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall,\" Obama told the crowd gathered in front of the U.S. Capitol building.<\/p> <p>The Obamas attended two official inauguration balls, including one held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. There the first couple danced to the <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/al-green-37614\">Al Green<\/a> classic \"Let's Stay Together,\" sung by <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/jennifer-hudson-507747\">Jennifer Hudson<\/a>. <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/alicia-keys-9542485\">Alicia Keys <\/a>and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/jamie-foxx-12782283\">Jamie Foxx <\/a>also performed.<\/p> <p>After the inauguration, Obama led the nation through many challenges—none more difficult, perhaps, than the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, which killed three people and left more than 200 injured. At a memorial service in Boston three days after the bombings, he told the wounded, \"Your country is with you. We will all be with you as you learn to stand and walk and, yes, run again. Of that I have no doubt. You will run again.\" And he applauded the city’s response to the tragedy. \"You’ve shown us, Boston, that in the face of evil, Americans will lift up what’s good. In the face of cruelty, we will choose compassion.\"<\/p><p>In the same month, Obama also found his efforts for gun-control measures thwarted in Congress. He had supported legislation calling for universal background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. When the bill was blocked and withdrawn, Obama called it “a pretty shameful day for Washington.”<\/p> <p>By June, Obama had suffered a significant drop in his approval ratings in a CNN/ORC International poll. In the wake of allegations of the Internal Revenue Service targeting conservative political organizations seeking tax-exempt status and accusations of a cover-up in the terrorist killings of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three others at a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, Obama’s approval rating declined to only 45 percent—his lowest rating in more than 18 months.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Experts also attributed the ratings slide to new revelations about the extent of the U.S. National Security Agency’s surveillance program. Obama defended the NSA's email monitoring and telephone wiretapping during a visit to Germany that June. \"We are not rifling through the emails of German citizens or American citizens or French citizens or anyone else,” he said. \"The encroachment on privacy has been strictly limited.\" Obama stated that the program had helped stop roughly 50 threats.<\/p> <p>In early July 2013, President Obama made history when he joined former President <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-w-bush-9232768\">George W. Bush<\/a> in Africa to commemorate the 15th anniversary of al-Qaeda’s first attack on American targets, the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. The event marked the first meeting between two U.S. presidents on foreign soil in commemoration of an act of terrorism.<\/p> <p>Later that month, Obama spoke out about the outrage that followed a Florida jury’s decision to acquit George Zimmerman in the murder of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. \"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,” the president remarked at a White House press conference. “Another way of saying that is <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/trayvon-martin-21283721\">Trayvon Martin <\/a>could have been me 35 years ago.\" Obama explained that this particular case was a state matter, but he discussed how the federal government could address some of the legislative and racial issues highlighted by the incident.<\/p><h2>International Challenges<\/h2> <p>Obama found himself grappling with an international crisis in late August and September 2013 when it was discovered that Syrian leader <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/bashar-al-assad-20878575\">Bashar al-Assad <\/a>had used chemical weapons against civilians. While saying that thousands of people, including over 400 children, had been killed in the chemical attacks, Obama called Syria's actions \"a serious national security threat to the United States and to the region, and as a consequence, Assad and Syria needs to be held accountable.\"<\/p> <p>The president worked to persuade Congress and the international community at large to take action against Syria, but found a majority on Capitol Hill opposed to military involvement. Obama then announced an alternative solution on September 10, 2013, by stating that if al-Assad agreed with the stipulations outlined in a proposal made by Russia to give up its chemical weapons, then a direct strike against the nation could be avoided. Al-Assad acknowledged the possession of chemical weapons and ultimately accepted the Russian proposal.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Later that month, Obama made diplomatic strides with Iran. He spoke with Iranian President <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/hassan-rouhani-21313175\">Hassan Rouhani<\/a> on the phone, which marked the first direct contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 30 years. This groundbreaking move by Obama was seen by many as a sign of thawing in the relationship between the United States and Iran. \"The two of us discussed our ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran's nuclear program,\" reported Obama at a press conference in which he expressed optimism that a deal could be reached to lift sanctions on Iran in return for that country’s willingness to halt its nuclear development program.<\/p><h2>Domestic Policies and Problems<\/h2> <p>Obama found himself struggling on the domestic front in October 2013. A dispute over the federal budget and Republican desires to defund or derail the Affordable Care Act caused a 16-day shutdown of the federal government. After a deal had been reached to end the shutdown, Obama used his weekly address to express his frustration over the situation and his desire for political reform: \"The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do—grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.\"<\/p> <p>The Affordable Care Act continued to come under fire in October after the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the website meant to allow people to find and purchase health insurance. Extra technical support was brought in to work on the troubled website, which was plagued with glitches for weeks. The health care law was also blamed for some Americans losing their existing insurance policies, despite repeated assurances from Obama that such cancellations would not occur. According to the&nbsp;<em>Chicago Tribune<\/em>, Obama insisted that the insurance companies—and not his legislation—caused the coverage change. \"Remember, before the Affordable Care Act, these bad-apple insurers had free rein every single year to limit the care that you received, or used minor pre-existing conditions to jack up your premiums, or bill you into bankruptcy,” he said.<\/p> <p>Under mounting pressure, Obama found himself apologizing regarding some health care changes. In an interview with NBC News, he said of those who lost their insurance plans, \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\" Obama pledged to find a remedy to this problem, saying, \"We are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.\"<\/p><h2>Managing Foreign Crises<\/h2> <p>The fall of 2013 brought Obama additional challenges in the area of foreign relations. In October 2013, German Chancellor <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/angela-merkel-9406424\">Angela Merkel <\/a>revealed that the NSA had been listening in to her cell phone calls. \"Spying among friends is never acceptable,\" Merkel told a summit of European leaders. In the wake of these controversies, Obama saw his approval rating drop to a new low in November 2013. Only 37 percent of Americans polled by CBS News approved of the job he was doing as president, while 57 percent disapproved of his handling of the job.<\/p> <p>Echoes of the Cold War also returned after civil unrest and protests in the capital city of Kiev led to the downfall of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's administration in February 2014. Russian troops crossed into Ukraine to support pro-Russian forces and the annexation of the province of Crimea. In response, Obama ordered sanctions targeting individuals and businesses considered by the U.S. government to be Ukraine agitators or involved in the Crimean crisis. \"In 2014 we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders,\" Obama stated. The president said the sanctions were taken in close coordination with European allies and gave the U.S. \"the flexibility to adjust our response going forward based on Russia's actions.”&nbsp;<\/p><p>In addition to the ongoing troubles in Ukraine, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians erupted into violence in Gaza during the summer of 2014. At the same time, tens of thousands of Central American children were being apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border after making the perilous crossing alone. Many Republicans called for the rapid deportation of these illegal immigrants, while others considered the situation a humanitarian crisis. Another of the president's woes came from the legislative branch. Speaker of the House <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/john-boehner-20656041\">John Boehner<\/a> launched an effort to sue Obama for overstepping his executive powers with some of his actions regarding the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In August 2014, Obama ordered the first airstrikes against the self-proclaimed Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which had seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria and conducted high-profile beheadings of foreign hostages. The following month, the U.S. launched its first attacks on ISIS targets in Syria, although the president pledged to keep combat troops out of the conflict. Several Arab countries joined in the airstrikes against the extremist Islamic militant group. \"The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force,” Obama said in a speech to the United Nations. “So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.\"&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Presidency After 2014 Elections<\/h2><p>That November, Obama had to cope with new challenges on the home front. Republicans made an impressive showing on Election Day and gained a majority in the Senate, meaning that Obama would have to contend with Republicans controlling both houses of Congress for the final two years of his term.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Obama flexed his presidential power in December by moving to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in more than 50 years. The policy change came after the exchange of American citizen Alan Gross and another unnamed American intelligence agent for three Cuban spies. In a speech at the White House, Obama explained that the dramatic shift in Cuban policy would \"create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people and begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas.\"<\/p><p>In renewing diplomatic ties with Cuba, Obama announced plans \"to increase travel, commerce and the flow of information to and from Cuba.\" The long-standing U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, however, remained in effect and could only be removed with the approval of Congress. Obama may not be able to sway Congress to agree on this policy shift as leading Republicans—including Boehner, McConnell and Florida Senator <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/marco-rubio-20840041\">Marco Rubio<\/a>—all spoke out against Obama's new Cuba policies.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In his 2015 State of the Union address,&nbsp;Obama declared that the nation was out of recession. \"America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back . . . know this: The shadow of crisis has passed,\" he said. He went on to share his vision for ways to improve the nation through free community college programs and middle-class tax breaks.&nbsp;<\/p><p>With Democrats outnumbered by Republicans in both the House and the Senate, Obama threatened to use his executive power to prevent any tinkering by the opposition on his existing policies. \"We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got to fix a broken system,\" he said. \"And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.\"<\/p><p>Not long after his State of the Union address, Obama traveled to India to meet with Prime Minister <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/narendra-modi\">Narendra Modi<\/a>. According to several news reports, Obama and Modi had reached a \"breakthrough understanding\" regarding India's nuclear power efforts. Obama told the Indian people in a speech given in New Delhi that \"we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement, which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon energy that helps fight climate change.\" This agreement would also open the door to U.S. investment in India's energy industry.<\/p><h2>Supreme Court Victories&nbsp;<\/h2><p>The summer of 2015 brought two major U.S. Supreme Court wins for the Obama administration. The court upheld part of the president's Affordable Care Act regarding health care tax subsidies. Without these tax credits, buying medical insurance might have become too costly for millions of Americans.&nbsp;<\/p><p>On June 26, the U.S. Supreme Court also made marriage equality a reality with its 5-4 decision to overturn an earlier 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that same-sex marriage bans in several states were constitutional. By reversing this earlier decision, the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal throughout the country. President Obama, who became the first president to voice support for same-sex marriage in May 2012, praised the court for affirming \"that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they've reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law. That all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.\"<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"b715GKJNWXA\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b715GKJNWXA\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b715GKJNWXA/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><p>In his speech, Obama also said that the court's decision \"is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, who talked to parents—parents who loved their children no matter what. Folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong . . . and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.\"<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"rRvBzzR5tdA\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRvBzzR5tdA\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rRvBzzR5tdA/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><p>On the same day as this landmark decision, President Obama grappled with an incident of racial violence by speaking at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, one of the nine African-Americans killed by a young white man during a Bible study meeting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In his eulogy for Pinckney, Obama said that the church’s late pastor \"embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words.\"<\/p><h2>Iran Nuclear Deal<\/h2><p>In July 2015, Obama announced that, after lengthy negotiations, the United States and five world powers had reached an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program. The deal would allow inspectors entry into Iran to make sure the country kept its pledge to limit its nuclear program and enrich uranium at a much lower level than would be needed for a nuclear weapon. In return, the U.S. and its partners would remove the tough sanctions imposed on Iran and allow the country to ramp up sales of oil and access frozen bank accounts.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As the administration began its effort to lobby Congress to endorse the deal, Obama made his first trip as president back to his father’s homeland of Kenya. In addition to having dinner with three-dozen relatives, some of whom he met for the very first time, Obama proudly proclaimed to a packed arena, “I am proud to be the first American president to come to Kenya—and of course I’m the first Kenyan-American to be president of the United States.”<\/p><h2>Clean Power Plan<\/h2><p>In August 2015, the Obama administration announced <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov//climate-change\">The Clean Power Plan<\/a>, a major climate change plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution&nbsp;from coal-burning power plants in the United States. President Obama called the plan the \"single most important step that America has ever made in the fight against global climate change.\"<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"RQ6N8zN3RCA\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ6N8zN3RCA\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQ6N8zN3RCA/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><p>The plan calls for aggressive Environmental Protection Agency regulations including requiring existing power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 and use more renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Under the regulations, states will be allowed to create their own plans to reduce emissions and are required to submit initial plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Critics quickly voiced loud opposition to the plan including Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, who sent a letter to every governor in the United States urging them not to comply with the regulations. States and private companies, which rely on coal production for their economic livelihoods, are also expected to legally challenge the plan.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Despite the backlash from those sectors, President Obama remained steadfast in his bold action to address climate change. \"We've heard these same stale arguments before,\" he said&nbsp;in an address from the White House.&nbsp;\"Each time they were wrong.\"<\/p><p>He added: \"We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.\"<\/p><h2>2015 Paris Climate Conference<\/h2><p>In November 2015, Obama further demonstrated his commitment to environmental issues as a primary player in the international COP21 summit held outside of Paris, France. Addressing the gathered representatives of nearly 200 countries, Obama acknowledged the United States’ position as the second-largest climate polluter and the nation’s primary responsibility to do something about it. The resulting Paris Agreement requires all participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the rise of global temperatures over the ensuing century and also to allocate resources for the research and development of alternative energy sources. President Obama praised the agreement for establishing the “enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis” and pledged that the United States would cut its emissions more than 25 percent by 2030. In September 2016, the United States and China, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, announced that their countries would ratify the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;One month later on October 5, 2016, the United Nations announced that the agreement had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to allow it to take effect starting on November 4, 2016.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Speaking from the Rose Garden at the White House, President Obama said: \"Today, the world meets the moment, and if we follow through on the commitments that this Paris Agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.”<\/p><p>\"One the reasons I ran for this office was to make America the leader in this mission,\" he continued, adding he was hopeful the historic agreement could make a difference. \"This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we've got.”&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Gun Control<\/h2><p>  Entering his final year as President of the United States, in early January 2016 Obama held a press conference to announce a new series of executive orders related to gun control. Citing examples such as the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, the president shed tears as he called on Congress and the gun lobby to work with him to make the country safer. His measures, which have met with vehement opposition from members of both the Republican and Democratic Parties, as well as gun advocacy groups such as the NRA, would implement more thorough background checks for gun buyers, stricter governmental oversight and enforcement of gun laws, better information sharing regarding mental health issues as related to gun ownership and investment in gun safety technology. According to a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/186236/americans-desire-stricter-gun-laws-sharply.aspx\">2015 Gallup poll<\/a>, most Americans favor some kind of stricter regulations of gun sales.<\/p><h2>Final Year in Office<\/h2><p>Entering his final year as President of the United States, in early January 2016 Obama held a press conference to announce a new series of executive orders related to gun control. Citing examples such as the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, the president shed tears as he called on Congress and the gun lobby to work with him to make the country safer. His measures, which have met with vehement opposition from members of both the Republican and Democratic Parties, as well as gun advocacy groups such as the NRA, would implement more thorough background checks for gun buyers, stricter governmental oversight and enforcement of gun laws, better information sharing regarding mental health issues as related to gun ownership and investment in gun safety technology. According to a 2015 Gallup poll, most Americans favor some kind of stricter regulations of gun sales.<\/p><p>Shortly after the press conference, on January 12, 2016, Barack Obama delivered what would be his final State of the Union address. Diverging from the typical policy-prescribing format, Obama’s message for the American people was centered around themes of optimism in the face of adversity, asking them not to let fears about security or the future get in the way of building a nation that is “clear-eyed” and “big-hearted.” This did not prevent him from taking thinly disguised jabs at Republican presidential hopefuls for what he characterized as their “cynical” rhetoric, making further allusions to the “rancor and suspicion between the parties” and his failure as president to do more to bridge that gap. But Obama also took the opportunity to tout his accomplishments, citing the Affordable Care Act, diplomatic progress with Iran and Cuba, the legalization of gay marriage and profound economic recovery as among them.<\/p><p>Further indicating his unwillingness to accept a “lame duck” status, two months later Obama made two important moves to attempt to cement his legacy.  On March 10 he met at the White House with newly elected <a href=\"/people/justin-trudeau\">Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau<\/a> in the first official visit by a Canadian leader in nearly 20 years. Central among the topics addressed during their meeting—which also included trade, terrorism and border security—was climate change, with the two leaders promising a commitment to building an international “low-carbon global economy.” Trudeau’s apparent concern for environmental issues and generally liberal agenda stand in contrast to his predecessor, <a href=\"/people/stephen-harper-39153\">Stephen Harper<\/a>, with whom President Obama enjoyed strained relations due in part to Obama’s unwillingness to allow for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.<\/p><p>A week after his meeting with Trudeau, Obama held a press conference at the White House to present 63-year-old U.S. Court of Appeals chief judge <a href=\"/people/merrick-garland-561802\">Merrick Garland<\/a> as his nominee for the Supreme Court seat vacated with the unexpected death of conservative stalwart <a href=\"/people/antonin-scalia-9473091\">Antonin Scalia<\/a>. Though Garland is considered a moderate “consensus” candidate, his nomination was immediately rebuffed by leaders of the Republican Party, who have repeatedly stated their intention to block any nominee put forward by President Obama, fearing that such a confirmation would tip the balance toward a more liberal-leaning court. In an allusion to the political standoff, President Obama closed his remarks about Garland by saying, “I am fulfilling my constitutional duty. I’m doing my job. I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee.” During his presidency, Obama already filled two seats in the Supreme Court, with <a href=\"/people/sonia-sotomayor-453906\">Sonia Sotomayor<\/a> and <a href=\"/people/elena-kagan-560228\">Elena Kagan<\/a>, though both were confirmed when there was a Democratic-majority Senate.<\/p><p>Leaving the Senate to weigh their options regarding his nomination of Merrick, President Obama set out on a historic mission to Cuba&nbsp;on March 20. The first sitting American president to visit the island nation since 1928, Obama made the three-day visit—accompanied by First Lady <a href=\"/people/michelle-obama-307592\">Michelle Obama<\/a>&nbsp;and their daughters Malia and Sasha. Obama's visit was part of a larger program to establish greater cooperation between the two countries, the foundations of which were laid in late 2014, when Obama and Cuban president <a href=\"/people/raul-castro-183536\">Raul Castro<\/a> announced the normalizing of diplomatic relations for the first time since 1961. At the top of the agenda during the milestone meeting between the two leaders were human rights, the U.S.’s economic embargo on Cuba and Guantanamo Bay. Following their first conversation at the Palace of the Revolution, Castro and Obama held a joint press conference broadcast on state television during which they fielded questions from the press. While they acknowledged its complexities, both also professed a shared optimism about the road ahead.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"video-gallery\"><h2>Videos<\/h2><\/section><div

She would later become a lawyer, Chicago city administrator, community-outreach  worker and—as the wife of President Barack Obama—the&nbsp;first African-American first lady of the United States.<\/p> <p>Michelle was raised in a small bungalow on Chicago's South Side. Her  father, Fraser Robinson, was a city-pump operator and a Democratic  precinct captain. Her mother, Marian, was a secretary at Spiegel's but later stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother, Craig. They were a close-knit family, typically sharing meals, reading and playing games together.<\/p> <p>Craig and Michelle, 21 months  apart in age, were often mistaken for twins. The siblings also shared  close quarters, sleeping in the living room with a sheet  serving as a makeshift room divider. They were raised with an  emphasis on education and had learned to read at home by age four. Both skipped the second grade.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"gifted-student\"><h2>Gifted Student<\/h2><p>By the sixth grade, Michelle was taking classes in her school's gifted program, where she  learned French and completed accelerated courses in biology. She went on to attend&nbsp;<a href=\"/people/whitney-young-jr-9539757\">Whitney M. Young<\/a> Magnet High School,&nbsp;the city's first magnet high school for gifted children, where, among  other activities, she served as the student government treasurer.&nbsp;In 1981, Michelle graduated from the school as class salutatorian.<\/p> <p>Following in her older brother's footsteps, Michelle then attended Princeton University, graduating cum laude in 1985 with a  B.A. in Sociology. She went on to study law at Harvard Law School, where she took part in demonstrations calling for the enrollment and hiring of more minority  students and professors. She was awarded her J.D. in 1988.<\/p><div tml-collection=\"ci01d08967b0002a83\" tml-render-style=\"slideshow\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\">\n    \n\n    \n    \n<\/div><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"marriage-to-barack-obama\"><h2>Marriage to Barack Obama<\/h2><p>After law school, Michelle worked as an associate in the Chicago  branch of the firm Sidley Austin, in the area of marketing and  intellectual property. It was there, in 1989, that she met her future husband, Barack  Obama, a summer intern to whom she was assigned as an adviser.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Initially, she refused to  date Barack, believing that their work relationship would make the  romance improper. She eventually relented, however, and the couple soon fell in  love.&nbsp;<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><strong>Did You Know?<\/strong>&nbsp;The Obamas' first kiss took place outside of a Chicago shopping center—where a plaque featuring a photo of the couple kissing was installed more than two decades later, in August 2012.<\/p><\/blockquote> <p>After two years of dating, Barack proposed, and the  couple married at Trinity United Church of Christ on October 3, 1992. Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively.&nbsp;<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"high-profile-work-in-chicago\"><h2>High-Profile Work in Chicago<\/h2><p>In 1991, Michelle decided to leave corporate law and pursue a career in public service, working as an assistant to Mayor Richard Daley and then as the assistant commissioner of planning and development for the City of Chicago.<\/p> <p>In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a nonprofit leadership-training program that helped young adults develop skills for future careers in the public sector.<\/p> <p>In 1996, Michelle joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, developing the school’s first community-service program. Beginning in 2002, she worked for the University of Chicago  Hospitals, as executive director of community  relations and external affairs.<\/p> <p>In May 2005, Michelle was appointed  vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center, where she continued to work part-time until shortly before her husband's inauguration as president. She also served as a board member for the prestigious Chicago Council on Global Affairs.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"supporting-her-husband\"><h2>On the Campaign Trail<\/h2><p>Michelle Obama first caught the eye of a national audience while at her husband's side when he delivered a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. Barack Obama was elected as U.S. Senator from Illinois that November.<\/p> <p>In 2007, Michelle scaled back her own professional work to attend to family and campaign obligations during Barack's run for the Democratic presidential nomination. When they were out on the trail, they would leave their daughters&nbsp;with their grandmother Marian, Michelle's mother. Barack Obama eventually won the nomination and was elected the 44th President of the United States. He was sworn in on January 20, 2009.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>When her husband sought reelection in 2012, facing a challenging race against Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"/people/mitt-romney-241055\">Mitt Romney<\/a>, Michelle Obama diligently campaigned on his behalf. She traveled the country, giving talks and making public appearances.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>In September of that year, Michelle delivered a noteworthy speech at the Democratic National Convention. \"Every day, the people I meet inspire me, every day they make me proud, every  day they remind me how blessed we are to live in the greatest nation on  earth,\" she said. \"Serving as your first lady is an honor and a privilege.\" She went on to praise the Latino community for supporting President Obama, and stated that her husband—\"the same man [she] fell in love with all those years ago\"—understands the American Dream, as well as the everyday struggles of American families, and cares deeply about making a difference in people's lives. Michelle won both public and critical praise for her narrative, called a \"shining moment\" by <em>The Washington Post<\/em>.<\/p> <p>On November 6, 2012, Barack Obama was reelected for a second term as U.S. president. After Mitt Romney conceded defeat, Michelle Obama accompanied her husband with their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, onto the stage at McCormick Place in Chicago, where President Obama delivered his victory speech.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Fashion Icon<\/h2><p>After her husband's political role pushed the Obama family into the spotlight, Michelle was publicly recognized for her no-nonsense campaign style as well as her sense of fashion. In May 2006, Michelle was featured in <em>Essence<\/em> magazine as one of \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women.\" In September 2007, Michelle was included in <em>02138<\/em> magazine as number 58 in \"The Harvard 100,\" a yearly list of the school's most influential alumni. She has also twice appeared on the cover of <em>Vogue and&nbsp;<\/em>made the <em>Vanity Fair<\/em> best-dressed list two years in a row as well as <em>People<\/em> magazine's 2008 best-dressed list.<\/p><p>During the inauguration ceremony for her husband's second term, on January 21, 2013,&nbsp;Michelle and her daughters received a lot of attention for their fashion choices, which included clothes from Thom Browne, J. Crew and Kate Spade. Michelle received much praise&nbsp;for the red Jason Wu dress she wore during the subsequent events.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"issues-and-causes\"><h2>Issues and Causes<\/h2><p>As the 44th first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama has  focused her attention on issues such as the support of military  families, helping working women balance career and family and  encouraging national service. During the first year of the Obama presidency, Michelle and her husband volunteered at homeless shelters and soup kitchens in the Washington D.C. area. Michelle also has made appearances at public schools, stressing the importance of  education and volunteer work.<\/p> <p>Ever conscious of her family's diet and health, Michelle&nbsp;has supported the organic-food movement, instructing the White House kitchens to prepare organic food for guests and her family. In March 2009, Michelle worked with 23 fifth graders from a local school in Washington D.C. to plant an 1,100-square-foot garden of fresh vegetables and install beehives on the South Lawn of  the White House. Since 2010, Michelle has put efforts to fight childhood obesity near the top of her agenda.<\/p> <p>Michelle Obama remains committed to her health-and-wellness causes. In 2012, she announced a new fitness program for kids as part of her Let's Move initiative. Along with the U.S. Olympic team and other sports organizations, she has worked to get young people to try out a new sport or activity. \"This year, 1.7 million young people will be participating in Olympic and Paralympic sports in their communities—many of them for the very first time. And that is so important, because sometimes all it takes is that first lesson, or clinic, or class to get a child excited about a new sport,\" she said in a statement.<\/p> <p>Putting her message in print, Michelle released a book as part of her mission to promote healthy eating. <em>American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America<\/em> (2012) explores her own experience creating a vegetable garden as well as the work of community gardens elsewhere. She told Reuters that sees the book as an opportunity to help readers understand \"where their food was coming from\" and \"to talk about the work that we're doing with childhood obesity and childhood health.\"<\/p><h2>Famed DNC Speech<\/h2><p>In July 2016, former first lady, senator and secretary of state <a href=\"/people/hillary-clinton-9251306\">Hillary Clinton<\/a> became the official Democratic nominee for the American presidency, becoming the first woman in the U.S. to win a major political party's presidential nomination. On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Michelle spoke in support of Clinton, who had previously run against Barack Obama during the 2008 primaries, and her vision of a progressive America.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\"...I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn,\" she said. \"And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters, and all our sons and daughters, now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.\"<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"first-family\"><h2>First Family<\/h2><p>Both Michelle and Barack Obama have stated that their personal priority is their two daughters, Malia and Sasha. The parents realized that the move from Chicago to Washington D.C. would be a major adjustment for any family. Residing in the White House, having Secret Service protection and always being in the wake of their parents' public obligations has dramatically transformed their lives. Both parents try to make their daughters' world as \"normal\" as possible, with set times for studying, going to bed and getting up. \"My first priority will always be to make sure that our girls are healthy and grounded,\" Michelle said. \"Then I want to help other families get the support they need, not just to survive, but to thrive.\"<\/p> <\/section><section

His father, William Jefferson Blythe, died in a car crash several months before Clinton was born, leaving him in the care of his mother, Virginia Cassidy Blythe. To provide for her son, Virginia moved to New Orleans, Louisiana to complete two years of nursing school, while Clinton stayed with his grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy. Clinton's grandparents were strict disciplinarians who instilled in him the importance of a good education. \"My grandparents had a lot to do with my early commitment to learning,\" Clinton later recalled. \"They taught me to count and read. I was reading little books when I was 3.\"<\/p> <p>Clinton's mother returned to Arkansas with a degree in nursing in 1950, and later that year she married an automobile salesman named Roger Clinton. Two years later, the family moved from Hope to Hot Springs, Arkansas. Although neither his parents nor his grandparents were religious, Clinton became a devoted Baptist from a very young age. On Sunday mornings, he woke himself up, put on his best dress clothes and walked half a mile to Park Place Baptist Church to attend services alone. Clinton was especially drawn to the gospel music performed at his church. He began playing the saxophone, and by the time he graduated from high school, many considered him the best jazz saxophonist in the city.<\/p> <p>Throughout his childhood, Clinton grew increasingly disturbed by his stepfather's drinking and abusive behavior toward his mother and younger half-brother. At the age of 14, already standing more than 6 feet tall, Clinton finally snapped. He told his stepfather, \"If you want them, you'll have to go through me.\" The abuse stopped, but Roger Clinton's drinking did not, and Clinton's mother divorced him in 1962.<\/p> <p>Clinton attended Hot Springs High School, a segregated all-white school, where he was a stellar student and a star member of the jazz band. The principal of Hot Springs High School, Johnnie Mae Mackey, placed a special emphasis on producing students devoted to public service, and she developed a strong bond with the smart and politically inclined Clinton.<\/p> <p>In June 1963, as a 17-year-old high school junior, he attended Arkansas Boys State, where he was elected the Arkansas representative to the American Legion's Boys Nation, earning him an invitation to meet <a href=\"/people/john-f-kennedy-9362930\">President John F. Kennedy<\/a> at the White House Rose Garden. A photograph of the young Bill Clinton shaking hands with President Kennedy has become an iconic image symbolizing a passing of the baton between generations of modern Democratic leadership. On the same trip, Clinton met another of his political heroes, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee J. William Fulbright. Clinton said, \"Fulbright I admired to no end ... He had a real impact on my wanting to be a citizen of the world.\"<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"college-education\"><h2>College Education<\/h2><p>Upon graduating from high school in 1964, Clinton attended Georgetown University to study international affairs. He immediately thrust himself into university politics, serving as the president of his freshman and sophomore classes. However, Clinton lost the election for student body president during his junior year, most likely because his classmates found him \"too political.\" Clinton began devoting his time to working as a clerk for the Foreign Relations Committee under Senator Fulbright, one of Congress's most outspoken critics of the Vietnam War. Clinton came to share Fulbright's view that the war was both immoral and contrary to the United States' best interests.<\/p> <p>After graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a highly prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study for two years at Oxford University. However, shortly after his arrival in England, Clinton received his draft notice and was forced to return to Arkansas. Clinton avoided military service by enrolling in the ROTC program at the University of Arkansas Law School, but instead of attending law school that fall, he instead returned to Oxford. Apparently feeling guilty about his decision to avoid the draft, Clinton resubmitted his name to the draft board, but he received a high enough lottery number to assure that he would not have to serve in Vietnam.<\/p> <p>Upon the completion of his Rhodes Scholarship, Clinton entered Yale Law School, where he met a bright young woman named Hillary Rodham, who shared his political ambitions. The pair graduated from Yale in 1973 and married two years later in 1975. They had their only child, a daughter named <a href=\"/people/chelsea-clinton-547578\">Chelsea<\/a>, in 1980. After graduating from Yale, the Clintons moved to Arkansas, where Bill began teaching at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville Law School and immediately thrust himself into politics. In 1974, he challenged Republican incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Clinton lost the race, but it was much closer than anyone had expected and the race marked him as a rising political star of the Arkansas Democratic Party. Two years later, Clinton was elected state attorney general, and then in 1978, at the age of 32, he easily defeated Republican Lynn Lowe to become one of the youngest governors in American history.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"governor-of-arkansas\"><h2>Governor of Arkansas<\/h2><p>Working closely with his wife Hillary, Clinton set out on an ambitious agenda to reform the state's education and health care systems. However, hampered by his youth and political inexperience, Clinton made several big blunders as governor. He poorly handled riots by Cuban refugees interned at Fort Chaffee and instituted a highly unpopular fee hike on auto licenses. At the time, Arkansas governors served only two-year terms, and at the conclusion of Clinton's first term in 1980 a little-known Republican challenger named Frank White shockingly knocked him out of office. Although the loss devastated Clinton, he refused to let it put an end to his promising political career. After working for two years at a Little Rock law firm, in 1982 Clinton once again sought out the governorship. Freely admitting his past mistakes and beseeching voters to give him a second chance, Clinton swept back into office. This time Clinton would hold onto the job for four consecutive terms.<\/p> <p>As governor, Clinton took a centrist approach, championing a mix of traditionally liberal and conservative causes. Appointing Hillary to head a committee on education reform, he instituted more rigorous educational standards and established competence tests for teachers. Clinton also championed affirmative action, appointing record numbers of blacks to key government positions. At the same time, Clinton favored the death penalty and put in place welfare reforms designed to put recipients back to work. Also noteworthy was Clinton's tactic of running the government like a political campaign, constantly consulting public opinion polls and pitching&nbsp;policies&nbsp;to the people through carefully orchestrated advertising campaigns.<\/p> <p>By the late 1980s, Clinton also sought to increase his own national visibility. From 1986-1987, he served as the chairman of the National Governors Association, and in the early 1990s he became actively involved in the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats seeking to move the party in a centrist direction. However, at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Clinton squandered an opportunity to announce himself as an obvious future presidential candidate when he delivered an excruciatingly long and boring nomination speech for Michael Dukakis. In a skillful bit of political damage control, Clinton quickly made fun of his disastrous speech on <em>The Tonight Show<\/em> with <a href=\"/people/johnny-carson-9239714\">Johnny Carson<\/a>.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"presidency\"><h2>U.S. Presidency<\/h2><p>In 1992, Clinton easily defeated his competitors in the Democratic primaries to become the party's nominee for the presidency, choosing Tennessee Senator <a href=\"/people/al-gore-9316028\">Al Gore <\/a>as his vice presidential running mate. The Republican incumbent <a href=\"/people/george-hw-bush-38066\">President George H.W. Bush<\/a> was vulnerable in the election of 1992 because he had broken his celebrated campaign promise not to raise taxes and, especially, because the national economy was mired in recession. Although Clinton's campaign was troubled by accusations of draft dodging and rumors of marital infidelity, he campaigned effectively by harping on economic issues. His political strategist James Carville posted a sign at Clinton campaign headquarters that pithily captured his message: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Clinton was also aided by the surprisingly successful third-party campaign of billionaire <a href=\"/people/ross-perot-9438032\">Ross Perot<\/a>, who siphoned off a significant portion of the Republican vote from President Bush. On November 3, 1992, Bill Clinton was elected the 42nd president of the United States.<\/p> <p>Despite several notable accomplishments, including the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the implementation of the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy for LGBT military personnel and the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Clinton's first years in office were largely unsuccessful. Through a task force headed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, he endorsed a massive health-care reform act that was designed to provide universal coverage. The bill failed to move through Congress, however, and became a massive political disaster, leading to Republicans regaining control of both houses of Congress in 1994.<\/p> <p>However, in an impressive political comeback, President Clinton again embraced centrist policies and rhetoric to restore his popularity in advance of the 1996 election. In 1994, he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a law that added 100,000 policemen and instituted harsher punishments for a variety of crimes, and in 1996 he signed a law increasing the national minimum wage. Despite the fact that a one-term presidency seemed a foregone conclusion two years earlier, in 1996 Clinton handily defeated Republican challenger <a href=\"/people/bob-dole-9276436\">Bob Dole<\/a> to secure a second term in office.<\/p> <p>Clinton's greatest accomplishment as president was leading the nation to a period of strong economic prosperity. While Clinton was in office, the nation enjoyed the lowest unemployment rates in recent times, the lowest inflation rate in decades, the highest home-ownership rates in its history and improved economic equality.<\/p> <p>Clinton's foreign policy achievements included presiding over the 1993 signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, at which the famous handshake between <a href=\"/people/yitzhak-rabin-37246\">Yitzhak Rabin<\/a> and <a href=\"/people/yasser-arafat-9187265\">Yasser Arafat<\/a> occurred, stabilizing war-torn Bosnia through the Dayton Peace Accords and helping to end Serbia's ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo. However, the failure of the American military mission in Somalia and the United States' inaction in the face of genocide in Rwanda stand out as major blemishes on Clinton's foreign policy record.<\/p> <p>Clinton's reputation also suffered from scandal in his personal life. His second term in the White House was dominated by the <a href=\"/people/monica-lewinsky-21292085\">Monica Lewinsky<\/a> scandal; the president at first denied, and then later admitted, that he had sexual relations with the 22-year-old White House intern. Congress appointed an independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who had previously been charged with investigating Clinton's Whitewater real estate matters to expand his investigation to include the affair. He produced a very explicit report with salacious details, known as the Starr Report. In 1998, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives impeached Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice for his actions in the Lewinsky affair. However, the Senate acquitted him on all charges in 1999.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"post-presidential-career\"><h2>Post-Presidential Career<\/h2><p>In the years since his presidency concluded in 2001, Bill Clinton has remained active on the global stage. Through the William J. Clinton Foundation (which he founded in 1997), Clinton created the Clinton Climate Initiative, dedicated to fostering research to combat climate change; the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual meeting of world leaders to discuss global issues; and the Clinton Foundation Haiti Fund, dedicated to rebuilding Haiti in the aftermath of its devastating 2010 earthquake. According to Clinton, the foundation's mission is \"to alleviate poverty, improve global health, strengthen economies and protect the environment by fostering partnerships among governments, businesses, nongovernmental organizations and private citizens.\"<\/p> <p>Clinton also played an active role in Hillary Clinton's failed 2008 presidential bid and, afterward, on <a href=\"/people/barack-obama-12782369\">Barack Obama<\/a>'s successful presidential campaign. In 2004, Clinton wrote a bestselling autobiography, <em>My Life<\/em>.<\/p> <p>Bill Clinton is one of the most important American political leaders of modern times. Despite facing an enormous backlash from the&nbsp;Lewinsky scandal, he has rejuvenated his image and remains a popular political figure. Clinton's presidency is still too recent to be judged by disinterested academic historians. Assessments of his successes and failures reflect the sharp political divides of the moment, and history has yet to reveal the full consequences of many of his policies. Nevertheless, Clinton himself offered his own preliminary evaluation of his presidency in his memoirs. He wrote, \"I judge my presidency primarily in terms of its impact on people's lives. That is how I kept score: all the millions of people with new jobs, new homes and college aid; the people who left welfare for work; the families helped by the family leave law; the people living in safer neighborhoods—all those people have stories, and they're better ones now.\"<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"in-recent-years\"><h2>In Recent Years<\/h2><p>Clinton showed his support for Democratic <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/groups/2012-election-candidates\">2012 election candidates<\/a>, incumbents President Barack Obama and <a href=\"/people/joe-biden-39995\">Vice President Joe Biden<\/a>, at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. In his speech at the convention, Clinton said that he wanted Obama to be \"the next standard-bearer of the Democratic,\" calling him a president who's \"cool on the outside, but who burns for America on the inside.\" The speech garnered wide success for Clinton in the form of positive news reports and social-network posts by fans.<\/p> <p>In November 2013, Clinton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest honor given to civilians. Recipients of the medal are chosen for their “meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,” according to the White House website.<\/p><p>On September 26, 2014, Clinton became a grandfather when daughter Chelsea gave birth to Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. His second grandchild, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born on June 18, 2016.<\/p><h2>Campaigning for Hillary&nbsp;<\/h2><p>Clinton has continued to be a force behind his foundation, which has overseen the distribution of millions&nbsp;of dollars from corporations, governments and individuals to globally-minded&nbsp;charitable works. The organization has dealt with issues ranging from providing increased access to HIV/AIDS medications to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Clinton has continued to stay in the media spotlight with special appearances that have included administering the oath of office in 2014 to New York City mayor <a href=\"/people/bill-de-blasio-21388699\">Bill De Blasio<\/a> and eulogizing boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2016.<\/p><p>Having previously served as secretary of state under the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton eventually launched a new campaign to be elected commander-in-chief. In July 2016, she became the official Democratic nominee for the American presidency, becoming the first woman in the U.S. to win a major political party's presidential nomination. During the Democratic National Convention, Bill, who had previously campaigned on behalf of his wife, spoke at length about the history of their dating and marriage, her Civil Rights work, her work on behalf of children, her&nbsp;commitment to diversity and the disenfranchised, her professional dedication as a public servant and her overall tenacity. \"For this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face, and she is still the best darn change maker I have ever known,\" he said in his speech.<\/p><p>After one of the most contentious presidential races in U.S. history, Donald Trump earned the majority of electoral votes and defeated Hillary Clinton on November 8, 2016. Trump's stunning victory defied pre-election polls and was considered a resounding rejection of establishment politics by blue-collar and working class Americans.<\/p><p>The day following the election, Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and&nbsp;her husband,&nbsp;along with vice presidential running mate <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/tim-kaine-338982\">Tim Kaine<\/a> and his wife, stood behind Hillary Clinton as she delivered an emotional concession speech. \"Our campaign was never about one person, or even one election,\" Hillary Clinton told her supporters. \"It was about the country we love and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.

tml-anchor=\"synopsis\"><h2>Synopsis<\/h2><p>Born in Pennsylvania on November 20, 1942, Joe Biden briefly worked as an attorney before turning to politics. He became the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history as well as Delaware's longest-serving senator. His 2008 presidential campaign never gained momentum, but Democratic nominee Barack Obama later selected him as his running mate. When Obama was elected in 2008, Biden became the 47th vice president of the United States. Biden earned a second term as vice president when President Obama was re-elected to the presidency in 2012.<\/p><\/section><div tml-anchor=\"image-joe-biden-39995-1-raw\">\n    <div tml-image=\"ci019b6c0204a6860d\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div>\n<\/div><section tml-anchor=\"early-years\"><h2>Early Years<\/h2><p>Long before reaching one of the highest political offices in the nation, Joe Biden—born on November 20, 1942—grew up in the blue-collar city of Scranton in northeast Pennsylvania. His father, Joseph Biden Sr., worked cleaning furnaces and as a used car salesman. His mother was Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Finnegan. Biden credits his parents with instilling in him toughness, hard work and perseverance. Biden has recalled his father frequently saying, \"Champ, the measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down, but how quickly he gets up.\" He's also said that when he would come home sullen because he had been bullied by one of the bigger kids in the neighborhood, his mother would tell him, \"Bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day!'\"<\/p> <p>Biden attended St. Paul's Elementary School in Scranton. In 1955, when he was 13 years old, the family moved to Mayfield, Delaware—a rapidly growing middle class community sustained primarily by the nearby DuPont chemical company.<\/p> <p>As a child, Biden struggled with a stutter, and kids called him \"Dash\" and \"Joe Impedimenta\" to mock him. He eventually overcame his speech impediment by memorizing long passages of poetry and reciting them out loud in front of the mirror. Biden attended the St. Helena School in Pennsylvania until he gained acceptance into the prestigious Archmere Academy. Although he had to work washing the school windows and weeding the gardens to help his family afford tuition, Biden had long dreamed of attending the school, which he called \"the object of my deepest desire, my Oz.\" At Archmere, Biden was a solid student and, despite his small size, a standout receiver on the football team. \"He was a skinny kid,\" his coach remembered, \"but he was one of the best pass receivers I had in 16 years as a coach.\" Biden graduated from Archmere in 1961.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"college-and-law-school\"><h2>College and Law School<\/h2><p>Biden attended the nearby University of Delaware, where he studied history and political science and played football. He would later admit that he spent his first two years of college far more interested in football, girls and parties than academics. But he also developed a sharp interest in politics during these years, spurred in part by the inspiring inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961.<\/p> <p>On a spring break trip to the Bahamas during his junior year, Biden met a Syracuse University student named Neilia Hunter and, in his own words, \"fell ass over tin cup in love—at first sight.\" Encouraged by his new love, he applied himself more fully to his studies and was accepted into the Syracuse University Law School upon his graduation from the University of Delaware in 1965. Biden and Hunter married the next year, in 1966. Biden was at best a mediocre law student. During his first year at Syracuse, he flunked a class for failing to properly cite a reference to a law review article, and although he claimed it was an accidental oversight, the incident would haunt him later in his career.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-political-career\"><h2>Early Political Career<\/h2><p>After graduating from law school in 1968, Biden moved to Wilmington, Delaware, to begin practicing at a law firm. He also became an active member of the Democratic Party, and in 1970 he was elected to the New Castle County Council. While serving as councilman, in 1971, Biden started his own law firm. In addition to his increasingly busy professional life, Biden had three children during these years: Joseph Biden III (born in 1969), Hunter Biden (born in 1970) and Naomi Biden (born in 1971). \"Everything was happening faster than I expected,\" Biden said about his life at the time.<\/p> <p>In 1972, the Delaware Democratic Party encouraged a 29-year-old Biden to run against the popular Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs for the United States Senate. Although few thought he stood any chance, Biden ran a tireless campaign organized mostly by family members. His sister, Valerie Biden Owens, served as his campaign manager, and both of his parents campaigned daily. That November, in a tight race with a large turnout, Biden won an upset victory to become the fifth-youngest U.S. senator elected in the nation's history.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"family-tragedy\"><h2>Family Tragedy<\/h2><p>Just as all of Biden's wildest dreams seemed to be coming true, he was struck by devastating tragedy. A week before Christmas in 1972, Biden's wife and three children were involved in a terrible car accident while out shopping for a Christmas tree. The accident killed his wife and daughter, and severely injured both of his sons, Beau and Hunter. Biden was inconsolable and even considered suicide. He recalls, \"I began to understand how despair led people to just cash in; how suicide wasn't just an option but a rational option ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.\"<\/p> <p>Nevertheless, at the encouragement of his family, Biden decided to honor his commitment to represent the people of Delaware in the Senate. He skipped the swearing-in ceremony for new senators in Washington and instead took the oath of office from his sons' hospital room. In order to spend as much time as possible with his sons, Biden decided to continue to live in Wilmington, commuting to and from Washington each day by Amtrak train, a practice he maintained through his entire long tenure in the Senate.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"senate-years\"><h2>Senate Years<\/h2><p>From 1973 to 2009, Biden served a distinguished Senate career. During his time in the Senate, Biden won respect as one of the body's leading foreign policy experts, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations for several years. His many foreign policy positions included advocating for strategic arms limitation with the Soviet Union, promoting peace and stability in the Balkans, expanding NATO to include former Soviet-bloc nations and opposing the First Gulf War. More recently, he advocated American action to end the genocide in Darfur and spoke out against President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War, particularly opposing the troop surge of 2007.<\/p> <p>In addition to foreign policy, Biden was an outspoken proponent of tougher crime laws. In 1987, Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork's failure to receive confirmation was largely attributed to harsh questioning by Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1994, Biden sponsored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act to add 100,000 police officers and increase sentences for a host of crimes.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"presidential-ambitions\"><h2>Presidential Ambitions<\/h2><p>In 1987, having established himself as one of Washington's most prominent Democratic lawmakers, Biden decided to run for the U.S. presidency. He dropped out of the Democratic primary, however, after reports surfaced that he had plagiarized part of a speech. Biden had been suffering severe headaches during the campaign, and shortly after he dropped out in 1988, doctors discovered that he had two life-threatening brain aneurysms. Complications from the ensuing brain surgery led to blood clots in his lungs, which, in turn, caused him to undergo another surgery. Always resilient, Biden returned to the Senate after surviving a seven-month recovery period.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"us-vice-president\"><h2>U.S. Vice President<\/h2><p>In 2007, twenty years after his first unsuccessful presidential bid, Biden once again decided to run for the U.S. presidency. Despite his years of experience in the Senate, however, Biden's campaign failed to generate much momentum in a field dominated by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Biden dropped out after receiving less than one percent of the vote in the crucial Iowa caucuses. Several months later, though, Obama—having secured the Democratic nomination after a hard-fought campaign against Clinton—selected Biden as his running mate. With his working-class roots, Biden helped the Obama campaign communicate its message of economic recovery to the blue-collar voters crucial to swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.<\/p> <p>On November 2, 2008, Barack Obama and Joe Biden convincingly defeated the Republican ticket of Senator John McCain and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. On January 20, 2009, Obama was sworn in as the 44th U.S. president and Biden became the 47th vice president. While Biden has mostly served in the role of behind-the-scenes adviser to the president, he has taken particularly active roles in formulating federal policies relating to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, the vice president used his well-established Senate connections to help secure passage of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation.<\/p> <p>A long-tenured U.S. senator and vice president, Biden is unquestionably one of the most important political figures in recent history. While he very clearly coveted the presidency in the late 1980s and early 2000s, in recent years, Biden has seemed to relish the opportunity to play a crucial role in the historic Obama Administration. Following the 2008 election, Biden said, \"This is an historic moment. I started my career fighting for civil rights, and to be a part of what is both a moment in American history where the best people, the best ideas, the how can I say it?—the single best reflection of the American people can be called upon—to be at that moment, with a guy who has such incredible talent and who is also a breakthrough figure in multiple ways—I genuinely find that exciting. It's a new America. It's the reflection of a new America.\"<\/p> <p>Running for re-election in 2012, the Obama-Biden team faced Republican challenger Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, and Romney's vice-presidential running mate, U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election, earning a second term as president and Biden another term as vice president. President Obama received nearly 60 percent of the electoral vote, and won the popular vote by more than 1 million ballots.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci01f461939000272f\" tml-image-caption=\"President Joe Biden Official Portrait (Photo: The White House (V011013DL-0556) [Public domain], via <a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AOfficial_portrait_of_Vice_President_Joe_Biden.jpg&quot;>Wikimedia Commons<\/a>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div> <p>Later that year, Biden showed just how influential a vice president he could be. He was instrumental in achieving a bipartisan agreement on tax increases and spending cuts to avoid the fiscal cliff crisis. With a looming deadline, Biden was able to hammer out a deal with noted Republican and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. On January 1, 2013, the fiscal cliff bill passed in the Senate after months of tough negotiations. The House of Representatives approved it later that day.<\/p> <p>Around this time, Biden also became a leading figure in the national debate about gun control. He was selected to head up a special task force on the issue after the school shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school that December. Biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to President Obama in January 2013. He helped craft 19 actions that the president could take on the issue using his power of executive order among other recommendations.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"personal-life\"><h2>Personal Life<\/h2><p>Biden has been married to his second wife, Jill Biden, since 1977. The couple's daughter, Ashley, was born in 1981.<\/p><p>On May 30, 2015, Biden suffered another personal loss when his son Beau died at the age of 46, after battling brain cancer. \"Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known,\" Biden wrote in a statement about his son.<\/p><p>Following this tragedy, Biden considered a run for the presidency, but he put the speculation about a possible presidential run to rest in October 2015 when he announced that he would not seek the 2016 Democratic nomination. In the White House Rose Garden with his wife Jill and President Obama by his side, Biden made his announcement, referring to his son's recent death in his decision making: \"As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I've said all along what I've said time and again to others, that it may very well be that the process by the time we get through it closes the window. I've concluded it has closed.\"<\/p><p>Biden also said: \"While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.\"<\/p><\/section><section

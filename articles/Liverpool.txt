Liverpool ( / ˈ l ɪ v ər p uː l / ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Merseyside in north west England with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015. [4] The city is the largest settlement in the Liverpool/Birkenhead metropolitan area which had an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. [5] The local authority is the Liverpool City Council , which is the largest authority within the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority . 

Liverpool historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire . [6] [7] It became a borough from 1207 and a city from 1880. In 1889 it became a county borough independent of Lancashire. Liverpool sits on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary and its growth as a major port is paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution . Along with general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city was also directly involved in Atlantic slave trade . Liverpool was home to both the Cunard and White Star Line , and was the port of registry of the ocean liner RMS Titanic and others such as the RMS Lusitania , Queen Mary , and Olympic . 

The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007, and it held the European Capital of Culture title together with Stavanger , Norway, in 2008. [8] Several areas of Liverpool city centre were granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004. The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City includes the Pier Head , Albert Dock , and William Brown Street . [9] Tourism forms a significant part of the city's economy. Labelled the "World Capital City of Pop" by Guinness World Records , the popularity of The Beatles and other groups from the Merseybeat era and later contributes to Liverpool's status as a tourist destination. Liverpool is also the home of two Premier League football clubs, Liverpool and Everton , matches between the two being known as the Merseyside derby . The world-famous Grand National horse race takes place annually at Aintree Racecourse on the outskirts of the city. 

Liverpool's status as a port city has contributed to its diverse population, which, historically, was drawn from a wide range of peoples, cultures, and religions, particularly those from Ireland and Wales. The city is also home to the oldest Black African community in the country and the oldest Chinese community in Europe. Natives of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians (or less commonly Liverpolitans) and colloquially as " Scousers ", a reference to " scouse ", a form of stew. [10] The word "Scouse" has also become synonymous with the Liverpool accent and dialect . [nb 1]

Origins of the name 

Pool is a common place name element in England from the Brythonic word for a pond, inlet, or pit, (cognate with the modern Welsh pwll ). The derivation of the first element remains uncertain, with the Welsh word Llif (an old name for the Atlantic Ocean also meaning flood, flow or current) as the most plausible relative. This etymology is supported by its similarity to that of the archaic Welsh name for Liverpool Llynlleifiad (the lake/pool that floods/overflows). [11] 

Other origins of the name have been suggested, including "elverpool", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey . [12] The name appeared in 1190 as "Liuerpul", [13] and it may be that the place appearing as Leyrpole , in a legal record of 1418, refers to Liverpool. [14] History Main articles: History of Liverpool and Timeline of Liverpool "Liverpool in 1680" the earliest known image of Liverpool A map of Liverpool's original seven streets (north to the left) Early history 

King John 's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool, [15] but by the middle of the 16th century the population was still only around 500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter , making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street). 

In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for the town were waged during the English Civil War , including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699 Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament , that same year its first slave ship, Liverpool Merchant , set sail for Africa. Since Roman times, the nearby city of Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey . As trade from the West Indies surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715. [16] [17] Substantial profits from the slave trade helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone , William Roscoe and Edward Rushton , were at the forefront of the abolitionist movement. 19th century 

By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine . Given the crucial place of both cotton and slavery in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, "the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself." [18] Inaugural journey of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, the first ever commercial railway line. 

For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, [19] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer . [20] Liverpool's status can be judged from the fact that it was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office. [21] 

In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city. [22] Lime Street, Liverpool , in the 1890s, St.George's Hall to the left, Great North Western Hotel to the right, Walker Art Gallery and Sessions House in the background. Statues of Prince Albert , Disraeli , Queen Victoria and Wellington's Column in the middle ground. 

As early as 1851 the city was described as "the New York of Europe". [23] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was drawing immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool , Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas , Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church , served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. 20th century 

The postwar period was marked by social unrest as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the economy. Union organizing and strikes took place in numerous locations, including police strikes in London among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors who had served with the UK settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in Cardiff , Newport and Barry , and there had been incidents in Glasgow , South Shields , London , Hull and Salford . [24] There were so many racial riots that summer in major cities of the United States [24] that a black leader termed it Red Summer . There were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities in that first postwar year. [24] Liverpool was the port of registry of the ill-fated ocean liner, the RMS Titanic . The words Titanic, Liverpool could be seen on the stern of the ship that sank in April 1912 with the loss of 1,517 lives (including numerous Liverpudlians). A Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic is located on the city's waterfront. 

The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. The Great Depression of the early 1930s saw unemployment in the city peak at around 30%. 

Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. This was the first British airport to be renamed after an individual: the late singer and composer John Lennon of the Beatles, an internationally known band beginning in the early 1960s, who was murdered in New York City. [25] 

During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill , with the city suffering a blitz second only to London's. [26] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool. [27] 

Germans made 80 air-raids on Merseyside , killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock , the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions of the city that survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne , Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. 

Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. A significant West Indian black community existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth , where housing was less expensive. 

The construction of suburban public housing expanded after the Second World War. Some of the older inner city areas were redeveloped for new homes. 

In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the " Merseybeat " sound, which became synonymous with The Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also strongly affected American music for years and were internationally popular. 

Previously part of Lancashire , and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool in 1974 became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside . 

From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline due to restructuring of shipping and industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, [28] standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously. [29] 

In the later 19th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. Mathew Street is one of many tourist attractions related to The Beatles, and the location of Europe's largest annual free music festival . 

At the end of the 20th century Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process which continues today. 21st century 

To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers ; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. 

Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as The Beatles , as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. 

In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project , a £920 m development based on Paradise Street This produced the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008. 

In 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included erection of La Princesse , a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel . 

Spearheaded by the multi-billion- pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects include new buildings in the Commercial District , the King's Dock , Mann Island , the Lime Street Gateway , the Baltic Triangle , the RopeWalks , and the Edge Lane Gateway . All projects could be eclipsed by the Liverpool Waters scheme, which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as UNESCO , which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status. 

On 9 June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014, [30] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951. [31] Inventions and innovations The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and its modern extension. The first such school in the world 

Liverpool has been a center of industrial and later innovation. Railways , transatlantic steamships, municipal trams, [32] electric trains [33] were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836 the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool. From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff . [34] 

The first School for the Blind , [35] Mechanics' Institute , [36] High School for Girls, [37] [38] council house [39] and Juvenile Court [40] were all founded in Liverpool. The RSPCA , [41] NSPCC , [42] Age Concern , [43] Relate , Citizen's Advice Bureau [44] and Legal Aid all evolved from work in the city. 

In the field of public health, the first lifeboat station , public baths and wash-houses, [45] sanitary act, [46] medical officer for health , district nurse , slum clearance , [47] purpose-built ambulance, [48] X-ray medical diagnosis, [49] school of tropical medicine , motorised municipal fire-engine, [50] free school milk and school meals, [51] cancer research centre, [52] and zoonosis research centre [53] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross , professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world. [54] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas , [55] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray . 

The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands , appointedin 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer. [56] [57] 

In finance, Liverpool founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association [58] and the first Institute of Accountants . The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s. [59] 

In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library , athenaeum society , arts centre [60] and public art conservation centre . [61] Liverpool is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , [62] as well as the oldest surviving repertory theatre, the Liverpool Playhouse . [63] Oriel Chambers , the first 'modern' building in the world 

In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers , the prototype of the skyscraper . The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey; [64] it was the largest store in the world at the time. [65] 

Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival . Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook. [66] [67] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. [68] In 1865 Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association . Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter . 

Shipowner Sir Alfred Lewis Jones introduced the banana to Great Britain in 1884. [69] 

The Mersey Railway , opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary [70] and the world's first deep-level underground stations . 

In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal -net. He also was a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing. Brodie oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road , the UK's first intercity highway , as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead . Described as "the eighth wonder of the world" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world, a title it held for 24 years. 

In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool, [71] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot , [72] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway , the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units , the first to employ automatic signalling, and the first to install an escalator. 

Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture; he produced three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano , Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys . 

The British Interplanetary Society , founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world. [73] 

In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside the capital to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the "significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life." [74] Government 

Liverpool has several tiers of government; the Mayor and Local Council, who are also stakeholders in the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority , the National Government and the European Parliament. 

Liverpool is officially governed by a Unitary Authority , as when Merseyside County Council was disbanded civic functions were returned to a district borough level. However several services such as the Police and Fire and Rescue Service , continue to be run at a county-wide level. Mayor and local council See also: Liverpool City Council The late Georgian Liverpool Town Hall A number of Liverpool City Council services are based in the Municipal Buildings 

The City of Liverpool is governed by the Directly elected mayor of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council , and is one of six metropolitan boroughs that combine to make up the Liverpool City Region . The Mayor is elected by the citizens of Liverpool every four years and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the council. The council's 90 elected councillors who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutinising the Mayor's decisions, setting the Budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities. [75] The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the Prime minister through his seat at the 'Cabinet of Mayors'. Discussions include pressing decision makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other Directly elected mayors in England and Wales . [76] The mayor is Joe Anderson . 

The city of Liverpool effectively has two Mayors. As well as the directly elected Mayor, there is the ceremonial 'Lord Mayor' (or civic Mayor) who is elected by the full city council at its annual general meeting in May, and stands for one year in office. The Lord Mayor acts as the 'first citizen' of Liverpool and is responsible for promoting the city, supporting local charities and community groups as well as representing the city at civic events. [77] The Lord Mayor is Councillor Frank Prendergast. [78] 

For local elections the city is split into 30 local council wards, [79] which in alphabetical order are: Allerton and Hunts Cross Anfield Belle Vale Central Childwall Church Clubmoor County Cressington Croxteth Everton Fazakerley Greenbank Kensington and Fairfield Kirkdale Knotty Ash Mossley Hill Norris Green Old Swan Picton Princes Park Riverside Speke-Garston St Michaels Tuebrook and Stoneycroft Warbreck Wavertree West Derby Woolton Yew Tree 

During the most recent local elections, held in May 2011 , the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the previous elections in May 2010 . [80] The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by the Liberal Democrats . Of the remaining seats the Liberal Party won three and the Green Party claimed two. The Conservative Party , one of the three major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City Council. [80] [81] 

In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was revealed to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding. [82] 

While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th Century was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years. [83] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied. [84] Liverpool City Region Combined Authority 

The City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts of the Liverpool City Region . Since 1 April 2014, some of the city's responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority . 

The combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and The Mayor of Liverpool, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. 

As of July 2015, negotiations are currently taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region. Discussions include whether to introduce an elected ‘Metro Mayor’ to oversee the entire metropolitan area. [85] Parliamentary constituencies and MPs See also: List of Parliamentary constituencies on Merseyside 

Liverpool has four parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in Westminster : Liverpool Riverside , Liverpool Walton , Liverpool Wavertree and Liverpool West Derby . [86] At the last general election , all were won by Labour with representation being from Louise Ellman , Steve Rotheram , Luciana Berger and Stephen Twigg respectively. Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent election this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party. [87] Geography Satellite imagery showing Liverpool Bay , Liverpool and the wider Merseyside area 

Liverpool has been described as having "the most splendid setting of any English city." [88] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W ﻿ / ﻿ 53.40000°N 2.98333°W ﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 km) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain . 

The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula . The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle , Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby , Huyton , Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Climate 

Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate , like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Historically, Bidston Observatory (actually located on the Wirral Peninsula) has provided the longest and most unbroken weather data for the Merseyside area. More recently, the Met Office has operated a weather station at Crosby. 

The absolute minimum temperature recorded at Bidston was −12.8 °C (9.0 °F) during January 1881, typically the coldest night of the year should fall to −4.0 °C (24.8 °F) (1971–2000 average) However, the variability of the local climate was exposed as the weather station at Crosby fell to −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) [89] during December 2010. 

The absolute maximum temperature recorded at Bidston was 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) in August 1990 – typically the warmest day of the year should reach 27.5 °C (81.5 °F) (1971–2000 average). The absolute maximum at Crosby is 33.5 °C (92.3 °F), recorded in July 2006. [90] 

Liverpool's moderated oceanic climate is in stark contrast to temperatures expected in continental Europe both at the same latitude as well as latitudes much further north, with very small swings between seasons in comparison. For example, areas in continental Scandinavia much further north experience hotter summers with longer heatwaves, whilst Liverpool just like the rest of the British Isles lacks a regular snowy winter, in spite of its geographically northerly location.

In 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned The Mersey Forest to complete A Green Infrastructure Strategy for the City. [96] Demography Main article: Demography of Liverpool Population of Liverpool City Council area, 1801–2011 [97] [98] Population The city 

At the 2011 UK Census the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census. [98] The population of the Liverpool area peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded in the 1931 census. [97] As with many British cities including London and Manchester , the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with towns such as Kirkby , Skelmersdale and Runcorn seeing a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s). [99] 

Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with 42.3 per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English average of 37.4 per cent. [100] [ not in citation given ] As of July 2014 [update] , 66 per cent of the population was of working age. [100] Urban and metropolitan area 

Liverpool is the largest local authority by populace, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool and is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Liverpool is defined as a standalone NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical purpose , and makes up part of the NUTS2 area "Merseyside" along with East Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates. 

The " Liverpool Urban Area " is a term used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to denote the urban area around the city to the east of the River Mersey . The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by Liverpool City Council into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of Sefton and Knowsley . As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as Haydock and St. Helens . Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas. [101] The population of this area as of 2011 was 864,211. 

The " Liverpool City Region " is an economic partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority as defined by the Mersey Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the Borough of Halton and has an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and. [102] 

In 2006 ESPON (now ( European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion ) released a study defining a "Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, labour pool, and commuter "Travel To Work Areas". The analysis grouped the Merseyside metropolitan county with the borough of Halton , Wigan in Greater Manchester, the city of Chester as well as number of towns in Lancashire and Cheshire including Ormskirk and Warrington , estimating the polynuclear metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people. [103] 

Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, [104] [105] [106] or megalopolis . [107] Ethnicity Chinatown Gate Chinatown, Liverpool 

According to data from the 2011 census, 84.8 per cent of Liverpool's population was White British , 1.4 per cent White Irish , 2.6 per cent White Other, 4.1 per cent Asian or Asian British (including 1.1 per cent British Indian and 1.7 per cent British Chinese), 2.6 per cent Black or Black British (including 1.8 per cent Black African) and 2.5 per cent mixed-race . 1.8 per cent of respondents were from other ethnic groups. [2] 

Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Black Liverpudlians can trace their ancestors in the city back ten generations. [108] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men. [109] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean , [110] Ghanaian , [111] and Somali [112] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. 

The city is home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century. [113] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest gateway outside of China. 

The city is also known for its large Irish population and its historically large Welsh population. [114] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as "the capital of North Wales." [114] Following the start of the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States. [115] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish. [116] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland , while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland , [117] but many more Liverpudlians are of Welsh or Irish ancestry. 

Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian , [110] Latin American , [118] Malaysian , [119] and Yemeni . [120] communities, which number several thousand each. Religion Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King 

The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, [121] including two Christian cathedrals. 

Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England. [122] 

The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas , colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). 

Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral , which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival , has one of the longest naves , largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral , on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park , was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens ' original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd . While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street , a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape. [123] [nb 2] The Al-Rahma Mosque in the Toxteth area of Liverpool 

Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool. [124] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed, and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000. [125] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue. 

Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane , Edge Hill . The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there. [126] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree [127] and a Bahá'í Centre in the same area. [128] 

The city had the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam , a lawyer who had converted to Islam , and set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road. [129] The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold to the City Council and converted into offices. [130] Plans have been accepted to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum. [131] There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque , in the Toxteth area of the city and a mosque recently opened in the Mossley Hill district of the city. The third mosque was also recently opened in Toxteth and is on Granby Street. LGBT community Main article: LGBT culture in Liverpool 

Liverpool has a large lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender/transsexual community. Economy Main article: Economy of Liverpool Apartment buildings within Liverpool's new commercial district 

The Economy of Liverpool is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre of one of the two core economies within the North West of England . [132] In 2006, the city's GVA was £7,626 million, providing a per capita figure of £17,489, which was above the North West average. [133] Liverpool's economy has seen strong growth since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006. [133] GDP per capita was estimated to stand at $32,121 in 2014, and total GDP at $65.8 billion. [134] 

In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by service sector industries , both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors. [133] Over recent years there has also been significant growth in the knowledge economy of Liverpool with the establishment of the Liverpool Knowledge Quarter in sectors such as media and life sciences. [135] Liverpool's rich architectural base has also helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London, [136] including doubling for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York, Paris and Rome. [137] [138] Liverpool One has helped move the city into the top five retail destinations in the UK 

Another important component of Liverpool's economy are the tourism and leisure sectors . Liverpool is the 6th most visited city in the United Kingdom [139] and one of the 100 most visited cities in the world by international tourists. [140] In 2008, during the city's European Capital of Culture celebrations, overnight visitors brought £188m into the local economy, [139] while tourism as a whole is worth approximately £1.3bn a year to Liverpool. [138] The city's new cruise liner terminal , which is situated close to the Pier Head , also makes Liverpool one of the few places in the world where cruise ships are able to berth right in the centre of the city. [141] Other recent developments in Liverpool such as the Echo Arena and Liverpool One have made Liverpool an important leisure centre with the latter helping to lift Liverpool into the top five retail destinations in the UK. [142] The Range Rover Evoque is manufactured at Jaguar Land Rover 's plant at Halewood . 

Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. [133] Nonetheless the city remains one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. [143] A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool2 , is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle. [144] Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm NYK and Danish firm Maersk Line , whilst shipping firm Atlantic Container Line has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. [145] [146] [147] Future plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known as Liverpool Waters , could see £5.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs. [148] 

Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. Landmarks Main articles: Architecture of Liverpool and Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City See also: List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool and List of public art in Liverpool Liverpool's Three Graces, the Royal Liver Building , Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building at the Pier Head 

Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture . [149] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire . [150] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed [151] and 85 are Grade II* listed. [152] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster [153] and more Georgian houses than the city of Bath . [154] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage , as England's finest Victorian city. [155] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City , the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology. [156] Waterfront and docks The Albert Dock contains the UK's largest collection of Grade I listed buildings as well as being the most visited multi-use attraction outside London 

As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock ) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes . [157] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Albert Dock , which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. [158] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley , it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum , International Slavery Museum , Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story . North of the city centre is Stanley Dock , home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse , which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area [159] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building. [160] 

One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head , renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building , the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces , these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool, and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world. [161] [162] [163] [164] Bluecoat Chambers , the oldest building in Liverpool city centre 

In recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the construction of the Echo Arena Liverpool and BT Convention Centre on Kings Dock , Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks . The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010. [165] [166] Commercial district and cultural quarter Victoria Street like many streets in the city centre is lined with dozens of listed buildings 

Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'. [167] 

The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's World Heritage site. [168] The neo-classical St George's Hall 

The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall , which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture , the building is noted as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain. [169] [170] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building , constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. [169] Amongst the other noted buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings , Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers , [171] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built. [172] 

The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library , Walker Art Gallery , Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool . The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture , of which the most prominent, St George's Hall , [173] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe. [174] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with " S.P.Q.L. " (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis ), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain . Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens , which was specifically developed for this purpose.

[176] Other notable landmarks Speke Hall Tudor manor house is one of Liverpool's oldest buildings West Tower has been the city's tallest building since completion in 2008 

While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall , a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598. [177] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interior, which was added in the mid-19th century. [178] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall , which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively. [179] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers , [180] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style, [181] [182] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren [183] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to larger site in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool. [181] Liverpool Cathedral is regarded as one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century and is one of the largest church buildings in the world

[187] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is noted as one of the first Cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design. [188] 

In recent years, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. The largest of these developments has been Liverpool One , which has seen almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (170,000 m 2 ) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space. [189] Around the north of the city centre several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award winning Unity Buildings and West Tower , which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building . Many future redevelopment schemes are also planned including Central Village (planning permission granted), [190] the Lime Street gateway (work started) [191] and the highly ambitious Liverpool Waters (early planning stage). [192] 

There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport , the University of Liverpool 's Victoria Building , (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University ), and the Adelphi Hotel , which was in that past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.

The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, utilising a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing. [259] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. 

A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population. [260] Sports stadiums Anfield , home of Liverpool F.C. 

Liverpool is home to the Premier League football clubs Everton and Liverpool F.C. Liverpool have played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 116 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s and only the Main Stand survives from before 1992. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star UEFA Elite Stadium with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort, and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. 

After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park . Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England. Molineux (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened Ibrox in 1887, while Celtic Park was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr. Barton prepared the land at 4½d a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost £132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill. Goodison Park , home of Everton F.C 

The ground was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match the 12,000 crowd saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for more than 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. 

Everton have been considering relocation since 1996, and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby , but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well as members of the local community. At one point there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either club. Media Radio City Tower , home to Radio City and a number of subsidiary stations 

The ITV region which covers Liverpool is ITV Granada . In 2006, the Television company opened a new newsroom in the Royal Liver Building. Granada's regional news broadcasts were produced at the Albert Dock News Centre during the 1980s and 1990s. [261] The BBC also opened a new newsroom on Hanover Street in 2006. 

ITV's daily magazine programme This Morning was famously broadcast from studios at Albert Dock until 1996, when production was moved to London. Granada's short-lived shopping channel "Shop!" was also produced in Liverpool until it was axed in 2002. 

Liverpool is the home of the TV production company Lime Pictures , formerly Mersey Television, which produced the now-defunct soap operas Brookside and Grange Hill . It also produces the soap opera Hollyoaks , which was formerly filmed in Chester and began on Channel 4 in 1995. All three series were/are largely filmed in the Childwall area of Liverpool. 

The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo , published by the Trinity Mirror group. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter ), is also one of the many other news outlets that covers the city. Radio stations include BBC Radio Merseyside , Capital Liverpool , Radio City , Radio City 2 and Radio City Talk . The last three are located in Radio City Tower which, along with the two cathedrals, dominates the city's skyline. The independent media organisation Indymedia also covers Liverpool, while 'Nerve' magazine publishes articles and reviews of cultural events. 

Liverpool has also featured in films; [262] see List of films set in Liverpool for some of them. In films the city has "doubled" for London, Paris, New York, Chicago, [263] Moscow, Dublin, Venice and Berlin. [19] [264] Notable people Main articles: List of people from Merseyside and List of bands from Merseyside Quotes about Liverpool "Lyrpole, alias Lyverpoole, a pavid towne, hath but a chapel ... The king hath a castelet there, and the Earl of Darbe hath a stone howse there. Irisch merchants cum much thither, as to a good haven ... At Lyrpole is smaul custom payed, that causith marchantes to resorte thither. Good marchandis at Lyrpole, and much Irish yarrn that Manchester men do buy there ..." – John Leland (antiquary) , Itinerary c. 1536–39 [265] "Liverpoole is one of the wonders of Britain ... In a word, there is no town in England, London excepted, that can equal [it] for the fineness of the streets, and the beauty of the buildings." Daniel Defoe – A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain , 1721–26 "[O]ne of the neatest, best towns I have seen in England." – John Wesley . Journal , 1755 "I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African's blood." Actor George Frederick Cooke (1756–1812) responding to being hissed when he came on stage drunk during a visit to Liverpool. [266] "That immense City which stands like another Venice upon the water ... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire ... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men." Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine , 1791 "I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool but the reality far surpasses my expectation" – Prince Albert , speech , 1846 "Liverpool ... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial." – Illustrated London News , 15 May 1886 "Liverpool is the 'pool of life' " – C.G. Jung , Memories, Dreams, Reflections , 1928 "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel ... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once ..." – J.B. Priestley , English Journey , 1934 "...if Liverpool can get into top gear again there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing – it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it…… The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England." – Ian Nairn , Britain's Changing Towns , 1967 International links This section needs additional citations for verification .

Many people from within the greater Merseyside area consider themselves thus, although many do not. Conversely, a number of people from Liverpool itself may not consider themselves Scousers, since the term for them may have pejorative overtones. ^ The term may have its origins in religious and racial sectarianism , which, while now largely disappeared, was once notoriously virulent in Liverpool.

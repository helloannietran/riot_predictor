Pullman is the largest city in Whitman County , located in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest in southeastern Washington state . The population was 29,799 at the 2010 census , estimated to have reached 31,682 in 2014. [5] Originally incorporated as Three Forks , the city was later renamed after industrialist George Pullman . 

Pullman is noted as a vastly fertile agricultural area known for its many miles of rolling hills and the production of wheat and legumes. It is best known as the home to Washington State University , a public research land-grant university , as well as the international headquarters of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories . Pullman is located eight miles (13 km) from Moscow, Idaho , home to the University of Idaho , and is served by the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport . 

In 2011 Bloomberg Businessweek selected Pullman as the "Best Place to Raise Kids" in Washington. Factors included affordability, safety, a family-friendly lifestyle, the quality of Pullman High School, the presence of Washington State University, and the natural beauty of the area. [6]

History [ edit ] 

About five years after European-American settlers established Whitman County on November 29, 1871, Bolin Farr arrived here, camping in 1876 at the confluence of Dry Flat Creek and Missouri Flat Creek, on the bank of the Palouse River . Within the year, Dan McKenzie and William Ellsworth arrived to stake claims for adjoining land. They named the first post office located here as Three Forks. In the spring of 1881, Orville Stewart opened a general store and Bolin Farr platted about 10 acres (40,000 m 2 ) of his land for a town. 

Pullman was incorporated 130 years ago in 1886 with a population of about 200 people. It was originally named Three Forks, after the three small rivers that converge there: Missouri Flat Creek, Dry Fork, and the South Fork of the Palouse River. In 1884, Dan McKenzie and Charles Moore (of Moscow) replatted the site and named it for American industrialist George Pullman . 

On March 28, 1890, the Washington State Legislature established the state's land grant college , but did not designate a location. Pullman leaders were determined to secure the new college and offered 160 acres (0.65 km 2 ) of land for its campus. Idaho Territory had established its land grant college in 1889; the University of Idaho was to be located in neighboring Moscow. On April 18, 1891, the site selection commission appointed by Washington's governor chose Pullman. [7] On January 13, 1892, the institution opened with 59 students under the name Washington Agricultural College and School of Science. It was renamed the State College of Washington in 1905, more commonly known as "Washington State College," and became Washington State University in 1959. [8] [9] [10] 

In 1961, Pullman became a non-chartered code city under the Mayor-Council form of government. The city has an elected mayor with an elected seven-member council and an appointed administrative officer, the city supervisor. Neighborhoods [ edit ] 

Pullman is situated across four major hills, which divide the city into nearly equal quarters: these are Military Hill, north of the Palouse River and west of North Grand Avenue; Pioneer Hill, south of Main Street and the downtown area, and east of South Grand Avenue; Sunnyside Hill, south of Davis Way and west of South Grand Avenue; and College Hill, north of Main Street and east of North Grand Avenue. 

The WSU campus is located on College Hill, and part of the area is an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The historic character of College Hill is manifest in its many early-twentieth century craftsman-style bungalows and two streets which retain their original red brick paving. See Red Brick Roads of Pullman, Washington (NE Palouse St./NE Maple St.) . [11] 

Companies associated with an expanding high-tech industry are located at the north end of the city, anchored by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) . The lab company was founded by Edmund Schweitzer , a Ph.D. graduate of WSU. SEL and other firms are located within the 107-acre (0.43 km 2 ) Pullman Industrial Park, run by the Port of Whitman County. Schools [ edit ] 

The Pullman School District consists of the following: [12] Franklin Elementary school Jefferson Elementary school Sunnyside Elementary school Lincoln Middle School Pullman High School 

Pullman High School (PHS) is attended by about 700 students, and is the city's only public high school. It is located on Military Hill. Its mascot for its athletic teams is the greyhound. PHS offers honors and advanced placement courses, along with Running Start course work through WSU and area community colleges, such as Spokane Falls Community College. [ which? ] Washington State University [ edit ] Main article: Washington State University 

Pullman is the site of the largest and original campus of Washington State University (WSU), a member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12) in NCAA Division I . WSU is well known for its veterinary medicine, business, architecture, engineering, agriculture, pharmacy, and communications schools. Geography and climate [ edit ] 

Pullman is located at 46°43′59″N 117°10′19″W ﻿ / ﻿ 46.733°N 117.172°W ﻿ / 46.733; -117.172 (46.733, -117.172). [13] at an elevation of 2,352 ft (717 m) above sea level . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 9.88 square miles (25.59 km 2 ), all of it land. [1] The water supply is a natural aquifer. The surrounding region, called the Palouse prairie , or simply the Palouse , is noteworthy for its fertile rolling hills where winter and spring wheat, barley, lentils, and peas are grown. Surrounding Palouse hills Climate [ edit ] 

The Palouse climate is classified as humid continental with four distinct seasons. This climate is typified by warm, dry summers followed by cold, snowy winters with short transitional seasons in between. Owing to the protective nature of the Cascade Range to its west, clear skies occur regularly throughout the year and rainfall is drastically less frequent in comparison to cities west of the mountains. Clouds of any variety are especially scant between June and September, which contributes to a diurnal temperature variation that is much higher during the summer compared to winter. Pullman averages 21 inches (530 mm) of precipitation throughout the year. The warmest month is August with an average daily high of 82 degrees (27.8 °C), while January is the coldest month with an average daily high of 35 degrees (1.67 °C). 

Precipitation is highly seasonal. Virtually no precipitation occurs between June and September, while the period of mid November through mid March commonly receives snowfall. Rain, though sporadic, is mostly recorded during the transitional seasons. December and January are the snowiest months, respectively, averaging 7.80 inches and 7.09 inches each. Areas of snowpack accumulate every winter and frequently last into March before melting entirely. Snowfall can also occur in the transitional months of October and April, though it is uncommon and usually melts within a day.

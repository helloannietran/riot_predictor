Oran ( Arabic : وهران ‎‎ Wahrān ; Berber : ⵡⴻⵀ Wehran ) is an important coastal city that is located in the north-west of Algeria . It is considered the second most important city after the capital Algiers , due to its commercial, industrial, and cultural importance. It is 432 km (268 mi) from Algiers. The total population of the city was 759,645 in 2008 (2008 [2] ), while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately 1,500,000, [3] making it the second largest city in Algeria. [4] 

The name "Wahran" (Oran in Arabic) is derived from the Berber word "uharan" that means (two lions). 

A legend says that in 900 AD, lions still lived in the area. The last two lions were hunted on a mountain near Oran and are elsewhere referred to as "mountain lions". [5]

History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Oran Overview [ edit ] 

During the Roman empire , a small settlement called Unica Colonia existed in the area of current Oran. but this settlement disappeared after the Arab conquest of the Maghreb . 

Present-day Oran was founded in 903 by Moorish Andalusi traders. [6] It was captured by the Castilians under Cardinal Cisneros in 1509, and Spanish sovereignty lasted until 1708, when the city was conquered by the Ottomans . Spain recaptured the city in 1732. However, its value as a trading post had decreased greatly, so King Charles IV sold the city to the Turks in 1792. Ottoman rule lasted until 1831, when it fell to the French . 

During French rule over Algeria during the 19th and 20th centuries, Oran was the capital of a département of the same name (number 92). In July 1940, the British navy shelled French warships in the port after they refused a British ultimatum to surrender; this action was taken to ensure the fleet would not fall into German hands, as the Nazis had defeated France and occupied Paris. The action increased the hatred of the Vichy regime for Britain but convinced the world that the British would fight on alone against Nazi Germany and its allies. The Vichy government held Oran during World War II until its capture by the Allies in late 1942, during Operation Torch . 

Before the Algerian War , 1954–1962, Oran had one of the highest proportions of Europeans of any city in North Africa. In July 1962, after a ceasefire and accords with France, the FLN entered Oran and were shot at by a European. A mob attacked pied-noir neighborhoods and massacred thousands of Europeans in Oran; [7] 453 have been said to have "disappeared." [8] This triggered a larger exodus of Europeans to France, which was already underway. Shortly after the end of the war, most of the Europeans and Algerian Jews living in Oran fled to France. In less than three months, Oran lost about half its population. Islamic dynasties (910-1509) [ edit ] Start year End year Event 910 1082 Oran became a perpetual object of conflict between the Umayyads of al-Andalus and the Fatimids of Kairouan . 1082 1145 Presence of Almoravids . In 1145, Tashfin ibn Ali perished in the outskirts of Oran while trying to flee the besieging Almohad troops, who had already captured Tlemcen , and defeated the Zenata . 1145 1238 Presence of Almohads . 1147 marked the beginning of a period of persecution of Oran's Jews. 1238 1509 Presence of the Zianides of Tlemcen and then the Marinid dynasty of Fes . The Oranians grew rich from protection by the Emir, the customs system (tariffs), trade with Marseilles , and the Italian Maritime Republics of Genoa and Venice , with whom, in 1250, Oran signed a commercial treaty for 40 years. Toward the end of the 14th century, celebrated Arab historian Ibn Khaldoun wrote, "Oran is superior to all other cities by its trade. It's a paradise for the unhappy one. Those who arrive poor in its walls, will leave it again rich." The city excelled in the export of lead, wool, skins, fine burnous, carpets, haïks, cumin, nuts, and galls, as well as black African slaves. Spanish period (1509-1708, 1732-1792) [ edit ] The Santa Cruz Fort, Oran . Santa Cruz is Spanish for " holy cross " 

Before the Spaniards, the Portuguese launched a failed expedition to capture the city in July 1501. Four years later, the Spanish took Mers-el-Kébir , located just four miles (6.4 km) to the west of the Oran. Thus began the first organized incursions against the city which, at the time, numbered 25,000 inhabitants and counted 6,000 fueros. Count Pedro Navarro , on the orders of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros , captured the city on May 17, 1509. The occupying forces set fire to the books and archives of the town. [9] 

By 1554, the Turks had reached Algiers. The governor of Oran, Count Alcaudete , allied himself with Moroccan Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh against them. Nine years later, in 1563, Álvaro de Bazán , Marquis de Santa Cruz, built the fort of Santa-Cruz , strategically placed at the top of a mountain, l'Aïdour, more than 1,000 ft (300 m) above the sea, directly to the west of the city. Pedro Garcerán de Borja, Grand Master of the Order of Montesa , was captain of Oran when, on July 14, 1568, John of Austria (the illegitimate son of Charles I and paternal half-brother of King Philip II ), led a flotilla of 33 galleys against the Algerians. 

In April 1669 the Spanish governor, the Marquis del los Vélez, expelled all the Jews who lived in Oran and Mers El Kébir [10] sending them to be resettled in either Nice , or Livorno . 

The Spanish rebuilt Santa Cruz Fort to accommodate their city governors. "The fortifications of the place were composed of thick and continuous walls of over two and a half kilometres in circumference, surmounted by strong towers spaced between them," with a central castle or kasbah where the Spanish governor had his headquarters. [ citation needed ] Under Spanish rule, the city continued to grow, requiring enlargement of the city walls. In spite of the improved fortifications, the city was the object of repeated attacks. Notable in this regard, Moroccan Sharif Moulay Ismail tried to force his way past the defences in 1707, only to see his army decimated. Ottoman period (1708-1732, 1792-1831) [ edit ] The Bey Othmane Mosque 

The Spaniards occupied the city until 1708, when the Turkish Bey , Mustapha Ben Youssef ( Bouchelaghem ) took advantage of the War of Spanish Succession to drive them out. 

In 1732, Spanish forces returned under José Carrillo de Albornoz , capturing the city from Bey Hassan in the Battle of Aïn-el-Turk . Spain maintained its hold over Oran for the next six decades. 

In the night after October 8, 1790, a violent earthquake claimed more than 3,000 victims in less than seven minutes. Charles IV saw no advantage in continuing the occupation of the city, which had become increasingly expensive and perilous. He initiated discussions with the Bey of Algiers . They signed a treaty on September 12, 1792 by which the Spanish transferred the city to the Ottoman Empire. After another earthquake damaged the Spanish defences, the forces of the Ottoman ruler of Algiers, Muhammad Bey (Muhammad Ben-Othman, or Muhammad Bey "el-Kebir"), took possession of Oran on October 8 of the same year. In 1792, the Ottomans settled a Jewish community there. In 1796, the Pasha Mosque (in honour of Hassan Pasha , Dey of Algiers ), was built by the Turks with ransom money paid for the release of Spanish prisoners after Spain's final departure. In 1830 the Beys moved their Algerian capital from Mascara to Oran. French period (1831-1962) [ edit ] Oran from steps of City Hall, 1894 Oran's city hall , dating from the French period. The Great Synagogue of Oran was confiscated and turned into a mosque, after Jewish Algerians left Algeria in 1962. 

The town of 10,000 inhabitants was still in the possession of the Ottoman Empire when a squadron under the command of captain Bourmand seized el-Kébir on December 14, 1830. The city was in a wretched state. On January 4, 1831, the French commanded by General Damrémont occupied Oran. In September 1831, General Berthezène appointed Mr. Pujol as mayor of Oran; he had been captain of cavalry in retirement and was wounded in the right hand under the Empire. 

In 1832, leading a force of five thousand men, the young Emir Abd al-Qadir attacked Oran. In April 1833, commander-in-chief, General Boyer, was replaced by the baron Louis Alexis Desmichels . The city's defenders, under attack by Abd al Qadir, held their ground [ citation needed ] . Since independence (1962) [ edit ] Etymology [ edit ] A mural depicting the slaying of the Terror of Oran 

The word derives from the Berber root hr, meaning lion (see also Tahert and Souk Ahras ). The name is attested in multiple Berber languages , for instance as uharu and ahra . A locally popular legend tells that in the period around 900 BC, there were sightings of lions in the area. The two last lions were killed on a mountain near Oran, and it became known as La montagne des lions ("The Mountain of Lions"). Two giant lion statues stand in front of Oran's city hall, symbolizing the city. Oran today [ edit ] 

Today, Oran is a major port and a commercial centre, and has three universities. The old quarter of Oran has a casbah and an 18th-century mosque . 

Oran has become a major trading centre for the wider area, serving Arzew, the area's oil/gas port as well as Sonatrach, the country's biggest oil and gas company. Sonalgas has built a new congress centre in Oran and in 2010 the 16th International Conference Exhibition on Liquefied Natural Gas was held in the city of Oran, which attracted around 3,000 visitors and major companies from around the world. To accommodate all visitors, new hotels are currently being constructed and floating hotels will be used in the future. Climate [ edit ] 

Oran features a semi-arid climate ( Köppen climate classification BSk / BSh ). Oran’s climate does show influences of a Mediterranean climate ; however the combination of the city's relatively high average annual temperature and relatively low annual precipitation precludes it from falling under that climate category. Oran averages 326 mm (13 in) of precipitation annually, the bulk of which falls between November and May. Summers are the warmest times of the year, with average high temperatures in the warmest month (August) approaching 32 degrees Celsius. Winters are the coolest times of the year in Oran, with high temperatures in the coolest month (January) at around 17 degrees Celsius.

The folk music Raï ("opinion" in Arabic), had its beginnings in Oran. This genre of music was formulated by shepherds in the 1930s through Arab and European influences. This music was surrounded by controversy due to women's key role in public performances of the music, as well as the hedonistic lyrics about love and alcohol. This led to strict governmental control in the area which led to arrests, injuries, and assassinations. [13] Many notable Raï musicians (including Cheb Hasni , Cheb Khaled , and Rachid Taha ) hail from Oran. The violinist Akim el Sikameya was also born in Oran.

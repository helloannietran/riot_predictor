Winnipeg ( i / ˈ w ɪ n ɪ p ɛ ɡ / ) is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada . It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. 

The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name comes from the Western Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for aboriginal peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2011, Winnipeg is the seventh most populated municipality in Canada. [12] Being located very far inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average January lows of around −21 °C (−6 °F) and average July highs of 26 °C (79 °F). [7] 

Known as the "Gateway to the West", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur , the Winnipeg Folk Festival , the Jazz Winnipeg Festival , the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival , and Folklorama . Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games . It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers ( Canadian football ), the Winnipeg Jets ( ice hockey ), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey) and the Winnipeg Goldeyes ( baseball ).

History [ edit ] Further information: History of Winnipeg and Timeline of Winnipeg history 

Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North , a location now known as " The Forks ". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. [13] Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg ; the name is a transcription of the Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water. [14] [15] Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs , rock art and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture. [16] Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area are varied and range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. [15] [17] 

In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. [18] The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark , which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area. [19] Settlement [ edit ] Winnipeg's old City Hall in 1887 

Sieur de La Vérendrye built the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge . [20] [21] French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years' War . [22] Many French and later British men who were trappers married First Nations women ; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the Métis because of sharing a traditional culture. [23] 

Lord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony ), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. [24] The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. [25] The two companies competed fiercely over trade. [26] The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long-standing rivalry. [27] Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. [28] The fort was destroyed by a flood in 1826 and was not rebuilt until 1835. [28] A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, can be found near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg. [29] 

In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion , a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel , and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation . [30] [31] [32] On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. [33] Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. [34] 

Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. [35] The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. [15] It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890. [36] 

By 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. [15] However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. [37] The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I . [38] 1919 strike to present [ edit ] The Winnipeg General Strike, 21 June 1919 

More than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike . [39] The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. [40] After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919; when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. [41] Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday ; the event polarized the population. [41] One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth , went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation , which later became the New Democratic Party . [42] 

The Manitoba Legislative Building , constructed mainly of Tyndall stone , opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled "Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise" (commonly known as the " Golden Boy "). [43] The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. [44] The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939. [15] In the Battle of Hong Kong , The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. [45] In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. [46] [47] When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood . [48] The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that. [49] 

Prior to 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. A consolidated metropolitan " unicity " government was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. [50] The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. [15] Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession , during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the Winnipeg Tribune , as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. [51] In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, [52] and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. [53] In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. [13] [15] The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011 . [54] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography and climate of Winnipeg River walkway near The Forks , with St. Boniface Cathedral in the background 

Winnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley , a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. [55] It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the "Gateway to the West". [15] Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. [56] It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg ( the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake ). [57] Winnipeg contains North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. [58] The city has a total area of 464.08 km 2 (179.18 sq mi). [5] 

Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red , Assiniboine , La Salle and Seine . [59] The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826 . Another large flood occurred in 1950 , which caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. [60] This flood prompted Duff Roblin 's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. [15] In the 1997 flood , flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota . [61] The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years. [62] Climate [ edit ] 

Winnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a humid continental climate [63] ( Köppen Dfb ) [64] Summers have a July mean average of 19.7 °C (67.5 °F). [65] Winters are the coldest and driest time of year, with the January mean average around −16.4 °C (2.5 °F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in). [66] Temperatures occasionally drop below −40.0 °C (−40 °F) [67] The actual air temperature drops below −30 °C (−22 °F) on average 12.6 days annually [7] and above 30 °C (86 °F) 13.3 days of the year. [68] On average there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average. [69] With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city in Canada. [70] Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over 20 inches (51 cm). [71] Thunderstorms are very common during summer, and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. [72] Wind chill is an issue in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as −57 °C (−71 °F) and on average there are 12 days of the year that can reach a wind chill below −40 °C (−40 °F). [7] 

The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was 42.2 °C (108 °F) on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily low temperature was 28.3 °C (83 °F) on July 12 1936 [73] The apparent heat can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity and on 25 July 2007 a 47.3 °C (117.1 °F) reading of the humidex was measured. [7] The coldest temperature ever recorded was −47.8 °C (−54 °F) on 24 December 1879. [74] 

The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe winters. The last spring frost is on average around May 23, whilst the first fall frost is on September 22. [7]

Cityscape [ edit ] See also: List of Winnipeg neighbourhoods , List of tallest buildings in Winnipeg , and Subdivisions of Winnipeg Downtown Winnipeg and the Exchange District 

There are officially 236 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg. [78] Downtown Winnipeg , the city's financial heart and economic core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street . It covers an area of about 1 square mile (2.6 km 2 ) and is the fastest growing high-income neighbourhood in the city. [79] More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges. [79] The past few decades have seen the downtown undergo major revitalization efforts; since 1999, over C$ 1.2 billion has been invested. [79] Legislative building 

Downtown Winnipeg's Exchange District is named after the area's original grain exchange, which operated from 1880 to 1913. [79] The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures, [79] Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square. [79] Other major downtown areas are The Forks , Central Park , Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown . Many of Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway . [80] 

Various residential neighbourhoods surround the downtown in all directions; expansion is greatest to the south and west, although several areas remain underdeveloped. [81] The largest park in the city, Assiniboine Park , houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden . [82] Other large city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park . The major commercial areas in the city are Polo Park , Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan),Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre,Osborne Village, and the Corydon strip. [83] The main cultural and nightlife areas are the Exchange District, The Forks, Osborne Village and Corydon Village (both in Fort Rouge), Sargent and Ellice Avenues (West End) and Old St. Boniface. [84] Osborne Village is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood, [85] as well as one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in Western Canada. [86] Demographics [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Winnipeg 

As of the Canada 2011 Census there were 663,617 people living in Winnipeg proper, [87] with approximately 730,018 living in the Winnipeg Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). [88] Thus, Winnipeg is Manitoba's largest city and Canada's seventh largest city. Furthermore, the city represents 54.9% of the population of the province of Manitoba, the highest population concentration in one city of any province in Canada. [89] [90] Apart from the city of Winnipeg, the Winnipeg CMA includes the rural municipalities of Springfield , St. Clements , Taché , East St. Paul , Macdonald , Ritchot , West St. Paul , Headingley , the Brokenhead 4 reserve , and Rosser and St. François Xavier . [91] Statistics Canada 's estimate of the Winnipeg CMA population as of 1 July 2015 is 793,428.

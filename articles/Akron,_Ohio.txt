Akron / ˈ æ k r ən / is the fifth-largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Summit County , the fourth most populous county in the state. The city is located in northeastern Ohio on the western edge of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau , approximately 39 miles (63 km) south of Lake Erie and was co-founded along the Little Cuyahoga River in 1825 by Simon Perkins and Paul Williams. The name derived from the Greek word "ἄκρον" signifying a summit or high point. Due to Eliakim Crosby founding "North Akron" (Cascade) in 1833, "South" was added to the city's name until the two merged into an incorporated village in 1836. Neighboring settlements Kenmore and Ellet were annexed in 1929. As of the 2015 Census Estimate, the city proper had a total population of 197,542, making Akron the 119th largest city in the United States, and the fifth largest city in Ohio. The Akron, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) covers Summit and Portage counties, and in 2010 had a population of 703,200. [5] Akron is also part of the larger Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area , which in 2013 had a population of 3,501,538, ranking 15th. Creating the first Joint Economic Development Districts , it did so with Springfield , Coventry , and Copley , also Bath in conjunction with Fairlawn . [6] Residents of Akron are called "Akronites". Akron has had many nicknames, three of which are "Rubber City" "Cross Roads of the Deaf", and "City of Invention". 

The city became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the Ohio and Erie Canal , as well as being connected to numerous others and railroad lines. With Goodyear , Gojo Industries , FirstEnergy , FirstMerit Corporation , and Time Warner Cable among employers, Akron's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, education, healthcare , and biomedical. Akron is home to the All-American Soapbox Derby , WGC-Bridgestone Invitational , Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens , Akron City Hospital ( LeBron James and Stephen Curry ), the Goodyear Polymer Center , and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) . It is also the former home of Goodrich , Firestone , General Tire , the National Inventors Hall of Fame , National Marble Tournament, Professional Bowlers Association , Women's Professional Mud Wrestling , and first National Football League Champions the Akron Pros . [7] Listed by Newsweek as one of ten Information Age high tech havens, [8] it was awarded by the National Civic League and National Arbor Day Foundation , plus named one of the world's most livable cities . [9] The city is the filming location and setting of multiple movies and books, and is mentioned in others including television programs, video games, and songs. Residents Frank and Charles Menches have a disputable claim of inventing the hamburger thus the annual national festival is locally hosted. A creature often referred to as the Kenmore Grassman is reported through history. 

Notable historical events that occurred in the city include the Akron School Law of 1847 creating the K-12 system , Sojourner Truth giving her Ain't I A Woman? speech in 1851, Ferdinand Schumacher supplying the Union Army with oats during the American Civil War , the popularization of the church architectural Akron Plan , the goiter prevention iodized salt Akron Experiment, City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health , portions of the 2014 Gay Games , and rise of the rubber , tire , and airship industries among others. With a population increase of 201.8% during the 1910s, it became the nation's fastest-growing city because of them which included stoneware , sewer pipe , fishing tackle , farming equipment , mining , match , zipper , and toy . [10] [11] Headquartered on the north side, mobster Rosario Borgio ran black hand operations, Pretty Boy Floyd's Walker-Mitchell mob was also headquartered in the city. Three major civil unrest events took place during the riot of 1900 , rubber strike of 1936 , and the Wooster Avenue riots of 1968 , Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois (1920) [12] and President Bill Clinton (1997). [13] both arrived giving speeches on race. Though part of the Underground Railroad while active, the city also had many officials who were members of the Ku Klux Klan which Wendell Willkie suppressed, and abolitionist John Brown as a resident. Also produced are a number of notable individuals, particularly in politics, athletics, and the entertainment industry.

History [ edit ] Original town plot of Akron 

In 1811, Paul Williams settled near the corner of what is now Buchtel Avenue and Broadway and suggested to surveyor of the Connecticut Land Company 's Connecticut Western Reserve General Simon Perkins , the co-founding of a town at the summit of the developing Ohio and Erie Canal . The name derived from the Greek word ἄκρον signifying a summit or high point. [14] Laid out in December 1825, where the South part of the Downtown, Akron neighborhood now is; Irish laborers working on the Ohio Canal built approximately 100 cabins nearby in autumn. 

Because of Eliakim Crosby's founding of "North Akron" (Cascade) in the Northern portion of what is now Downtown Akron in the year 1833, "South" was added to Akron's name up until about 3 years later when the two were merged and became an incorporated village in 1836. [15] In 1840 Summit County formed from portions of Portage , Medina , and Stark counties. Akron replaced Cuyahoga Falls as its county seat a year later and opened a canal connecting to Beaver, Pennsylvania , helping give birth to the stoneware , sewer pipe , fishing tackle , and farming equipment industries. [10] [11] In 1844, abolitionist John Brown moved into the John Brown House across the street from business partner Colonel Simon Perkins who lived in the Perkins Stone Mansion . The Akron School Law of 1847 began the K-12 grade school system , which currently is used in every U.S. state. Also in 1847 the Akron Public Schools was founded, and also the very first School was built which is now a museum located on Broadway Street near the Corner with Exchange in what would have been original Akron prior to the 1836 merger. [16] 1850s–1890s: Summit City [ edit ] Quaker Square as it appeared in 1979 

When the Ohio Women's Rights Convention came to Akron in 1851, Sojourner Truth extemporaneously delivered her speech named Ain't I A Woman? , at the Universalist Old Stone Church. Associated with the church, John R. Buchtel founded Buchtel College in 1870, renamed the University of Akron in 1913. Purchasing a mill in 1856, Ferdinand Schumacher mass-produced oat bars which the Union Army were supplied with during the American Civil War , becoming high in demand afterward. Akron incorporated as a city in 1865. [17] Philanthropist Lewis Miller , Walter Blythe, and architect Jacob Snyder designed the widely used Akron Plan , debuting it on Akron's First Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872. [18] Numerous Congregational , Baptist , and Presbyterian churches built between the 1870s and World War I use it. [19] [20] In 1883, a local journalist began the modern toy industry by founding the Akron Toy Company . A year later, the first popular toy was mass-produced clay marbles made by Samuel C. Dyke at his shop where Lock 3 Park is now. Other popular inventions include rubber balloons; ducks; dolls; balls, Baby Buggy Bumpers, and Little Brown Jugs. In 1895, the first long distance electric railway, the Akron, Bedford and Cleveland Railroad , began service. [21] On August 25, 1889, the Boston Daily Globe referred to Akron with the nickname "Summit City". [22] To assist local police, the city deployed the first police car in the U.S. running on electricity. [23] 1900s–1990s: Rubber Capital of the World [ edit ] See also: Akron Rubber Strike of 1936 Goodyear headquarters 

The Riot of 1900 resulted in city officials being assaulted, two deaths, plus Columbia Hall and the Downtown Fire station (now the City Building since 1925) burning to the ground. [24] The American trucking industry was birthed through Akron's Rubber Capital of the World era when the four major tire companies Goodrich Corporation (1869), Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (1898), Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (1900), [25] and General Tire (1915) [26] [27] were headquartered in the city. The numerous jobs the rubber factories provided for deaf people led to Akron being nicknamed the "Crossroads of the Deaf". [28] On Easter Sunday 1913, Akron's total rainfall was recorded at 9.55 inches resulting in a flood which killed five citizens and destroyed the Ohio and Erie Canal system. From 1916–1920 10,000 schoolgirls took part in the successful Akron Experiment, testing iodized salt to prevent goiter in what was known as the "Goiter Belt". [29] 

Rubber companies responded to housing crunches by building affordable housing for workers. Goodyear's president, Frank Seiberling , built the Goodyear Heights neighborhood for employees. Likewise, Harvey Firestone built the Firestone Park neighborhood for his employees. [30] During the 1910–1920 decade Akron became a boom town being America's fastest growing city with a 201.8% increase in population. Of the 208,000 citizens, almost one-third were immigrants (also Clark Gable ) [31] and their children from places including Europe and West Virginia. In 1929 and 1931 Goodyear's subsidiary Goodyear-Zeppelin Company manufactured two airships for the United States Navy, the USS Akron ZR-4 and the USS Macon ZR-5. Goodyear built a number of blimps for the Navy during WWII and later for advertising purposes. [32] [33] [34] Akron again grew when Kenmore was annexed by voter approval on November 6, 1928. Found hiding under a bed at one of his hideouts in the city, notorious bank robber Charles Arthur " Pretty Boy " Floyd was arrested under the name "Frank Mitchell" in March 1930. [35] Goodyear became America's top tire manufacturer after merging with The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company in 1935. [36] Lasting five weeks and consisting of roughly 5,000 strikers including union sympathizers from other factories and neighboring states, the Akron Rubber Strike of 1936 successfully used "sit-down" tactic being organized by the United Rubber Workers. [37] During the 1950s–60s Akron surged as use of the automobile did. The historic Rubber Bowl was used by the National Guard of the United States as a base during the racial Wooster Avenue Riots of 1968 . Like many other industries of the Rust Belt , both the tire and rubber industries experienced major decline. By the early 1990s, Goodyear was the last major tire manufacturer based in Akron. 2000s: City of Invention [ edit ] The UofA displays the Archives of the History of American Psychology 

Despite the number of rubber workers decreasing by approximately half from 2000–07, Akron's research in polymers gained an international reputation. [38] It now centers the Polymer Valley which consist of 400 polymer-related companies, of which 94 were located in the city itself. [8] Research is focused at the University of Akron which is home to the Goodyear Polymer Center and National Polymer Innovation Center , and first College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering. Because of its contributions to the Information Age , Newsweek 's listed Akron fifth of ten high tech havens in 2001. [8] In 2008 "City of Invention" was added to the seal when the All-America City Award was received for the third time. Some events of the 2014 Gay Games used the city as a venue. 

The city also continues to deal with the effects of air and soil pollution from its industrial past. In the southwestern part of the city, soil was contaminated and noxious PCB -laden fumes were put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation that existed from the 1930s to the 1960s. Cleanup of the site, designated as a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency , began in 1987 and concluded in 2000. The area remains restricted with regular reviews of the site and its underground aquifer. [39] [40] [41] Geography [ edit ] Downtown Akron from the All-America Bridge 

Akron is located in the Great Lakes region approximately 39 miles (63 km) south of Lake Erie , on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau . It is bordered by Cuyahoga Falls on the north, and Barberton in the southwest. It is the center of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area which covers Summit and Portage counties, and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area . Located on the western end of the plateau, the topography of Akron includes rolling hills and varied terrain. The Ohio and Erie Canal passes through the city, separating the east from west. Akron has the only biogas facility [42] in the United States that produces methane through the decomposition process of sludge to create electricity. [43] According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of 62.37 square miles (161.5 km 2 ), of which 62.03 square miles (160.7 km 2 ) (or 99.45%) is land and 0.34 square miles (0.88 km 2 ) (or 0.55%) is water. [44] Climate [ edit ] 

Akron has a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ), typical of the Midwest , with four distinct seasons, and lies in USDA hardiness zone 6b, degrading to zone 6a in the outlying suburbs. [45] Winters are cold and dry but typically bring a mix of rain, sleet, and snow with occasional heavy snowfall and icing. January is the coldest month with an average mean temperature of 26.1 °F (−3.3 °C), [46] with temperatures on average dropping to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on 3.8 days and staying at or below freezing on 41 days per year. [46] Snowfall averages 47.5 inches (121 cm) per season, significantly less than the snowbelt areas closer to Lake Erie . [46] The snowiest month on record was 37.5 inches (95 cm) in January 1978, while winter snowfall amounts have ranged from 82.0 in (208 cm) in 1977–78 to 18.2 in (46 cm) in 1949–50. [46] Springs generally see a transition to fewer weather systems that produce heavier rainfall. Summers are typically very warm and humid with temperatures at or above 90 °F (32 °C) on 8.0 days per year on average; the annual count has been as high as 36 days in 1931, while the most recent year to not reach that mark is 2004. [46] July is the warmest month with an average mean temperature of 72.0 °F (22 °C). [46] Autumn is relatively dry with many clear warm days and cool nights. 

The all-time record high temperature in Akron of 104 °F (40 °C) was established on August 6, 1918, and the all-time record low temperature of −25 °F (−32 °C) was set on January 19, 1994. [46] The first and last freezes of the season on average fall on October 18 and April 26, respectively, allowing a growing season of 174 days. [46] The normal annual mean temperature is 49.8 °F (9.9 °C). [46] Normal yearly precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1981–2010 is 39.62 inches (1,006 mm), falling on an average 158 days. [46] Monthly precipitation has ranged from 12.55 in (319 mm) in July 2003 to 0.20 in (5.1 mm) in September 1960, while for annual precipitation the historical range is 65.70 in (1,669 mm) in 1990 to 23.79 in (604 mm) in 1963.

As a result of multiple towns merging, and industry boom, Akron's architecture is diverse. 

Originally a canal town, the city is divided into two parts by the Ohio and Erie Canal , with downtown being centered on it. Along the locks, the city has a path paved with rubber. 

Akron was awarded with the City Livability Award in 2008 for its efforts to co-purpose new school buildings as community learning centers. In 2009, the National Arbor Day Foundation designated Akron as a Tree City USA for the 14th time. [9] 

Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Summit County Courthouse , the Akron-Summit County Public Library , and John S. Knight Center are fairly old. 

The First Methodist Episcopal Church first used the Akron Plan in 1872, the plan later gained popularity, being used in many Congregationalists , Baptists , and Presbyterians . [18] [49] 

The city is home to a historic 1920s atmospheric movie palace , the Akron Civic Theatre . One of the building's features is a starry sky with clouds that drift over it when the lights are dimmed.

The gender makeup of the city was 48.3% male and 51.7% female. Education [ edit ] See also: Category:Education in Akron, Ohio and List of University of Akron people Goodyear Polymer Center 

Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the Akron City School District . Planning of the district began in 1840, when Ansel Miller suggested to build free public schools for all children in the city, paid for by property taxes. After enduring much opposition by citizens, in 1843 Miller joined with Rev. Isaac Jennings. Three years later, Jennings became the chairman of a committee of citizens who discussed how to improve the school system. On November 21, 1846, their plan was approved unanimously by the citizens. The Ohio Legislature adopted the plan, called "An act for the support and better regulation of the Common Schools of the Town of Akron" on February 8, 1847. Akron's first public schools were established in the fall of 1847 and were led by Mortimer Leggett. The first annual report showed that it cost less than $2 a year to educate a child. In 1857 the cost of running the schools for a year was $4,200. The primary schools were taught by young women, which the Akron Board of Education justified because they could be paid less and were under the supervision of a male superintendent. From 1877 to 1952, Akron graduated students semi-annually instead of annually. 9% of the city's school-aged population were born in other countries in 1888. In the 1920s, an Americanization program was designed to help the many Akron students who were first-generation Americans. Classes were in the rubber companies and some of the schools. A "continuation school" began for working boys and girls who were required by law to have at least four hours of schooling a week. In 1924, Akron's platoon schools attracted visitors from all over the country. Being a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan during the decade, the majority of school board and government officials were members. Their influence ended with the arrival of Wendell Willkie . During the city's 1950s boom town phase, Akron schools grew eight times faster than the city's population. In 1967, Kenmore launched the Air Force JROTC. In 1971, Jennings piloted the middle school model, which moved ninth-graders to the senior high school. In 1984, all-day kindergarten was piloted at Seiberling, Rankin and Hatton schools, and Ellet, East and Garfield high schools piloted the in-school suspension program. The district received an A+ evaluation from the state in 1987. [145] In 2009 Akron-Summit County Public Library was recognized with a 5 star rating by Library Journal [146] 

The city is home to the University of Akron , which the Princeton Review listed among the Best in the Midwest , in 2008. [147] Originally Buchtel College, the school is home of the Goodyear Polymer Center and the National Polymer Innovation Center . [148] All Akron Public Schools are currently going through a 15-year, $800 million rebuilding process. [149] In recent times the city's schools have been moved from "Academic Watch" to "Continuous Improvement" by the Ohio Department of Education . [150] Akron also has many private, parochial and charter schools. Akron Public Schools made headlines in 2004 when a freshman student of Akron Digital Academy, the district's own online charter school, was not allowed to participate in extracurricular activities, an event later covered and satirized by The Daily Show . National Basketball Association player LeBron James , attended St. Vincent–St. Mary High School . Transportation [ edit ] Airports [ edit ] Akron Fulton International Airport administration building 

The primary terminal that airline passengers traveling to or from Akron use is the Akron-Canton Regional Airport , serving nearly 2 million passengers a year. The Akron-Canton Airport is a commercial Class C airport located in the city of Green , [151] roughly 10 mi (16 km) southeast of Akron operated jointly by Stark and Summit counties. It serves as an alternative for travelers to or from the Cleveland area as well. Akron Fulton International Airport is a general aviation airport located in and owned by the City of Akron that serves private planes. It first opened in 1929 and has operated in several different capacities since then. The airport had commercial scheduled airline service until the 1950s and it is now used for both cargo and private planes. [152] It is home of the Lockheed Martin Airdock , where the Goodyear airships, dirigibles, and blimps were originally stored and maintained. The Goodyear blimps are now housed outside of Akron in a facility on the shores of Wingfoot Lake in nearby Suffield Township . Railroads [ edit ] Akron Northside Station 

Akron Northside Station is a train station at 27 Ridge Street along the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad . [153] 

Because of the city's large rubber industry, Akron was once serviced by a variety of railroads who competed for the city's freight and passenger business. The largest of these railroads were the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , Erie Railroad , and the Pennsylvania Railroad . Smaller regional railroads included the Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad , Northern Ohio Railroad , and the Akron Barberton Belt Railroad . [154] [ page needed ] Today the city is only serviced by CSX Corporation which has a de facto monopoly on all rail freight transport to and from the city. There is currently no passenger rail transportation. Bus and public transportation [ edit ] Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center 

Public transportation is available through the METRO Regional Transit Authority system, which has a fleet of over two hundred buses and trolleys and operates local routes as well as running commuter buses into downtown Cleveland. Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) also has a bus line running between Canton and Akron and the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) runs an express route connecting the University of Akron with Kent State University . [155] Metro RTA operates out of the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center on South Broadway Street. This facility, which opened in 2009, also houses inter-city bus transportation available through Greyhound Lines . [156] Freeways [ edit ] 

Akron is served by two major interstate highways that bisect the city. Unlike other cities, the bisection does not occur in the Central Business District, nor do the interstates serve downtown; rather, the Akron Innerbelt and to a lesser extent Ohio State Route 8 serve these functions. The Innerbelt looking northeast Interstate 77 connects Marietta, Ohio to Cleveland , Ohio. In Akron, it features 15 interchanges, four of which permit freeway-to-freeway movements. It runs north-south in the southern part of the city to its intersection with I-76 , where it takes a westerly turn as a concurrency with Interstate 76. Interstate 76 connects Interstate 71 to Youngstown, Ohio and farther environs. It runs east-west and has 18 interchanges in Akron, four of which are freeway-to-freeway. The East Leg was rebuilt in the 1990s to feature six lanes and longer merge lanes. The concurrency with Interstate 77 is eight lanes. The Kenmore Leg is a four-lane leg that is slightly less than two miles (3 km) long and connects to Interstate 277. Interstate 277 is an east-west spur that it forms with US 224 after I-76 splits to the north to form the Kenmore Leg. It is six lanes and cosigned with U.S. 224. View of Akron from the south looking north The Akron Innerbelt is a six-lane, 2.24-mile (3.60 km) spur from the I-76/I-77 concurrency and serves the urban core of the city. Its ramps are directional from the interstates, so it only serves west side drivers. ODOT is considering changing this design to attract more traffic to the route. The freeway comes to an abrupt end near the northern boundary of downtown where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The freeway itself is officially known as "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Freeway". The freeway was originally designed to connect directly to State Route 8, but plans were laid to rest in the mid-1970s because of financial troubles. Ohio State Route 8 is an original state highway that is a limited access route that connects Akron's northern suburbs with Interstates 76 and 77. State Route 8's southern terminus is at the central interchange, where it meets I-76 and I-77. The second freeway in Akron to be completed, it went through a major overhaul in 2003 with new ramps and access roads. In 2007 ODOT began a project to upgrade the road to interstate highway standards north of Akron from State Route 303 to I-271, providing a high speed alternative to Cleveland. [157] Crime [ edit ] Main article: Crime history of Akron, Ohio Summit County Courthouse and police car. The modern police car originated in Akron in 1899. [23] 

In 1999, Akron ranked as the 94th most dangerous city and the 229th safest, on the 7th Morgan Quitno list. [158] Preliminary Ohio crime statistics show aggravated assaults increased by 45% during 2007. [159] Akron became the first city in the United States to train and equip officers with the CornerShot , to aid them in fighting crime. [160] The city invented the first patrol cars to assist officers. 

Historically, organized crime operated in the city with the presence of the Black Hand led by Rosario Borgio , once headquartered on the city's north side in the first decade of the 20th century [ citation needed ] and the Walker-Mitchell mob, of which Pretty Boy Floyd was a member. [161] Akron has experienced several riots in its history including, the Riot of 1900 and the Wooster Avenue Riots of 1968 . Methamphetamine history [ edit ] 

The distribution of methamphetamine ("meth") in Akron greatly contributed to Summit County becoming known as the "Meth Capital of Ohio". The county ranks third in the nation in the number of registered meth sites. [162] During the 1990s, motorcycle gang the Hells Angels sold the drug from bars frequented by members. [163] Between January 2004 and August 2009, the city had significantly more registered sites than any other city in the state. [164] Authorities believe a disruption of a major Mexican meth operation attributed to the increase of it being made locally. [165] In 2007, APD received a grant to help continue its work with other agencies and jurisdictions to support them in ridding the city of meth labs. [166] The Akron Police Department coordinates with the Summit County Drug Unit and the Drug Enforcement Administration, forming the Clandestine Methamphetamine Laboratory Response Team.

Miami ( / m aɪ ˈ æ m i / ; Spanish pronunciation: [maiˈami] [7] ) is a seaport city at the southeastern corner of the U.S. state of Florida . As the seat of Miami-Dade County , the municipality is the principal, central, and most populous of its metropolitan area and part of the second-most populous metropolis in the southeastern United States . [8] [9] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Miami's metro area is the eighth-most populous and fourth-largest urban area in the U.S., with a population of around 5.5 million. [10] [11] 

Miami is a major center, and a leader in finance, commerce, culture, media, entertainment, the arts, and international trade. [12] [13] In 2012, Miami was classified as an Alpha−World City in the World Cities Study Group's inventory. [14] In 2010, Miami ranked seventh in the United States in terms of finance, commerce, culture, entertainment, fashion, education, and other sectors. It ranked 33rd among global cities. [15] In 2008, Forbes magazine ranked Miami "America's Cleanest City", for its year-round good air quality, vast green spaces, clean drinking water, clean streets, and citywide recycling programs. [16] According to a 2009 UBS study of 73 world cities, Miami was ranked as the richest city in the United States, and the world's fifth-richest city in terms of purchasing power . [17] Miami is nicknamed the "Capital of Latin America " [1] and is the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality. [18] 

Downtown Miami is home to the largest concentration of international banks in the United States, and many large national and international companies. [19] [20] The Civic Center is a major center for hospitals, research institutes , medical centers, and biotechnology industries. For more than two decades, the Port of Miami , known as the "Cruise Capital of the World", has been the number one cruise passenger port in the world. It accommodates some of the world's largest cruise ships and operations, and is the busiest port in both passenger traffic and cruise lines. [21] [22] 

In a study by the website 24/7 Wall Street , Miami was rated as the worst U.S. city in which to live. The primary factors cited were crime, poverty, income inequality and housing costs that far exceeded the national median. [23]

History Main articles: History of Miami and Timeline of Miami See also: National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami, Florida Approximately 400 men voted for Miami's incorporation in 1896 in the building to the left. 

The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous cultures. The Tequestas occupied the area for a thousand years before encountering Europeans. An Indian village of hundreds of people dating to 500–600 B.C. was located at the mouth of the Miami River. [24] 

In 1566 the explorer, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , claimed it for Spain . A Spanish mission was constructed one year later in 1567. Spain and Great Britain successively "controlled" Florida, and Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the US built Fort Dallas as part of its development of the Florida Territory and attempt to suppress and remove the Seminole . The Miami area subsequently became a site of fighting during the Second Seminole War . 

Miami is noted as "the only major city in the United States conceived by a woman, Julia Tuttle ", [25] a local citrus grower and a wealthy Cleveland native. The Miami area was better known as "Biscayne Bay Country" in the early years of its growth. In the late 19th century, reports described the area as a promising wilderness. [26] The area was also characterized as "one of the finest building sites in Florida." [27] The Great Freeze of 1894–95 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced Henry Flagler , a railroad tycoon , to expand his Florida East Coast Railway to the region, for which she became known as "the mother of Miami." [28] [29] Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300. [30] It was named for the nearby Miami River , derived from Mayaimi , the historic name of Lake Okeechobee . [31] The Freedom Tower , built in 1925, is Miami's historical landmark . 

Black labor played a crucial role in Miami's early development. During the beginning of the 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population. [32] :25 Whatever their role in the city's growth, their community's growth was limited to a small space. When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans in neighborhoods close to Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white men with torches visited the renting families and warned them to move or be bombed. [32] :33 

During the early 20th century, northerners were attracted to the city, and Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure. The legacy of Jim Crow was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police, H. Leslie Quigg, did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan . Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, "personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman." [32] :53 

The collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s , the 1926 Miami Hurricane , and the Clutch Plague in the 1930s slowed development. When World War II began, Miami, well-situated on the southern coast of Florida, became a base for US defense against German submarines . The war brought an increase in Miami's population; by 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city. 

After Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the population. The city developed businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South . In the 1980s and 1990s, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars, immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew . [33] Racial and cultural tensions were sometimes sparked, but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center. It is the second-largest US city (after El Paso , Texas ) with a Spanish-speaking majority, and the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality. [18] 

Miami and its metropolitan area grew from just over 1,000 residents to nearly 5.5 million residents in just 110 years (1896–2006). The city's nickname, The Magic City , comes from this rapid growth. Winter visitors remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic. [33] Geography The mouth of the Miami River at Brickell Key 

Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the Florida Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east, which also extends from Florida Bay north to Lake Okeechobee . The elevation of the area never rises above 40 ft (12 m) [34] and averages at around 6 ft (1.8 m) [35] above mean sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest undulations are found along the coastal Miami Rock Ridge , whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands , the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach . The Gulf Stream , a warm ocean current , runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year. Geology View from one of the higher points in Miami, west of downtown. The highest natural point in the city of Miami is in Coconut Grove , near the bay, along the Miami Rock Ridge at 24 feet (7.3 m) above sea level . [36] 

The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone . This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages . Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau , stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas . The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans . Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level . 

Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer , [37] a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay , with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah . Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade . [ citation needed ] 

Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the Everglades , a subtropical marshland located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida. Alligators have ventured into Miami communities and on major highways. 

In terms of land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. According to the US Census Bureau , the city encompasses a total area of 55.27 sq mi (143.1 km 2 ). Of that area, 35.67 sq mi (92.4 km 2 ) is land and 19.59 sq mi (50.7 km 2 ) is water. That means Miami comprises over 400,000 people in 35 square miles (91 km 2 ), making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, along with New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

Map of Miami neighborhoods. The Downtown area has the fastest-growing neighborhoods in the city. 

Miami is partitioned into many different sections, roughly into North, South, West and Downtown. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami and is technically on the eastern side of the city. This area includes Brickell , Virginia Key , Watson Island , and PortMiami . Downtown is South Florida 's central business district, and Florida's largest and most influential central business district. Downtown has the largest concentration of international banks in the U.S. along Brickell Avenue . Downtown is home to many major banks, courthouses , financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks and a large residential population. East of Downtown, across Biscayne Bay is South Beach . Just northwest of Downtown, is the Civic Center , which is Miami's center for hospitals, research institutes and biotechnology with hospitals such as Jackson Memorial Hospital , Miami VA Hospital, and the University of Miami 's Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine . 

The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way , The Roads and Coconut Grove . Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 connecting Downtown with Coral Gables , and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets. Coconut Grove was established in 1825 and is the location of Miami's City Hall in Dinner Key , the Coconut Grove Playhouse , CocoWalk , many nightclubs , bars, restaurants and bohemian shops, and as such, is very popular with local college students . It is a historic neighborhood with narrow, winding roads, and a heavy tree canopy. Coconut Grove has many parks and gardens such as Villa Vizcaya , The Kampong , The Barnacle Historic State Park , and is the home of the Coconut Grove Convention Center and numerous historic homes and estates. 

The western side of Miami includes Little Havana , West Flagler, and Flagami , and is home to many of the city's traditionally immigrant neighborhoods. Although at one time a mostly Jewish neighborhood, today western Miami is home to immigrants from mostly Central America and Cuba , while the west central neighborhood of Allapattah is a multicultural community of many ethnicities. 

The northern side of Miami includes Midtown , a district with a great mix of diversity with many West Indians , Hispanics , European Americans , bohemians , and artists. Edgewater , and Wynwood , are neighborhoods of Midtown and are made up mostly of high-rise residential towers and are home to the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts . The wealthier residents usually live in the northeastern part, in Midtown, the Design District , and the Upper East Side , with many sought after 1920s homes and home of the MiMo Historic District , a style of architecture originated in Miami in the 1950s. The northern side of Miami also has notable African American and Caribbean immigrant communities such as Little Haiti , Overtown (home of the Lyric Theater ), and Liberty City . Climate Main article: Climate of Miami 

Miami has a tropical monsoon climate ( Köppen climate classification Am ) [38] [39] with a marked drier season in the winter. Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer , and proximity to the Gulf Stream shape its climate. With January averaging 68.2 °F (20.1 °C), winter features highs generally ranging between 73–80 °F (23–27 °C). Cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front , which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season. Lows fall below 50 °F (10 °C), an average of 10-15 nights during the winter season following the passage of cold fronts. Typical summer afternoon thunderstorm rolling in from the Everglades . 

The wet season begins some time in May, ending in mid-October. During this period, temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s (29–35 °C), accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean , which then allow lower temperatures, but conditions still remain very muggy. Much of the year's 55.9 inches (1,420 mm) of rainfall occurs during this period. Dew points in the warm months range from 71.9 °F (22.2 °C) in June to 73.7 °F (23.2 °C) in August. [40] 

Extremes range from 27 °F (−2.8 °C) on February 3, 1917 to 100 °F (38 °C) on July 21, 1940. [41] While Miami has never officially recorded snowfall at any official weather station since records have been kept, snow flurries fell in some parts of Miami on January 19, 1977. [42] [43] [44] [45] 

Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season, which is mid-August through the end of September. [46] Although tornadoes are uncommon in the area, one struck in 1925 and again in 1997 . 

Miami falls under the USDA 10b/11a Plant Hardiness zone . [47]

[97] Miami-influenced, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine , hit the popular music scene with their Cuban-oriented sound and had hits in the 1980s with "Conga" and "Bad Boys". [98] 

Miami is also considered a "hot spot" for dance music , [99] [100] Freestyle , a style of dance music popular in the 1980s and 90s was heavily influenced by Electro , hip-hop, and disco. [101] Many popular Freestyle acts such as Pretty Tony, Debbie Deb , [102] Stevie B , [103] and Exposé , [104] originated in Miami.

The new sound fed back into mainstream clubs across the country. The scene in SoBe, along with a bustling secondhand market for electronic instruments and turntables, had a strong democratizing effect, offering amateur, "bedroom" DJs the opportunity to become proficient and popular as both music players and producers, regardless of the whims of the professional music and club industries. Some of these notable DJs are John Benetiz (better known as JellyBean Benetiz), Danny Tenaglia , and David Padilla . [115]

The Miami area has a unique dialect, (commonly called the "Miami accent") which is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- or third-generation Hispanics , including Cuban-Americans , whose first language was English (though some non-Hispanic white , black , and other races who were born and raised the Miami area tend to adopt it as well.) [119] It is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially the New York area dialect , Northern New Jersey English , and New York Latino English .) Unlike Virginia Piedmont , Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect (see section below), "Miami accent" is rhotic ; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is syllable-timed ). [120] However, this is a native dialect of English, not learner English or interlanguage ; it is possible to differentiate this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers in that "Miami accent" does not generally display the following features: there is no addition of /ɛ/ before initial consonant clusters with /s/ , speakers do not confuse of /dʒ/ with /j/ , (e.g., Yale with jail ), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [ ɹ ] instead of alveolar tap [ ɾ ] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.

Miami International Airport serves as the primary international airport of the Greater Miami Area. One of the busiest international airports in the world, Miami International Airport caters to over 35 million passengers a year. The airport is a major hub and the single largest international gateway for American Airlines . Miami International is the busiest airport in Florida, and is the United States' second-largest international port of entry for foreign air passengers behind New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport , and is the seventh-largest such gateway in the world. The airport's extensive international route network includes non-stop flights to over seventy international cities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. 

Alternatively, nearby Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport also serves commercial traffic in the Miami area. [140] Opa-locka Airport in Opa-locka and Kendall-Tamiami Airport in an unincorporated area serve general aviation traffic in the Miami area. PortMiami The Royal Caribbean International headquarters at the Port of Miami . Further information: PortMiami 

Miami is home to one of the largest ports in the United States, the PortMiami . It is the largest cruise ship port in the world. The port is often called the "Cruise Capital of the World" and the "Cargo Gateway of the Americas". [141] It has retained its status as the number one cruise/passenger port in the world for well over a decade accommodating the largest cruise ships and the major cruise lines. In 2007, the port served 3,787,410 passengers. [142] Additionally, the port is one of the nation's busiest cargo ports, importing 7.8 million tons of cargo in 2007. [142] Among North American ports, it ranks second only to the Port of South Louisiana in New Orleans in terms of cargo tonnage imported/exported from Latin America. The port is on 518 acres (2 km 2 ) and has 7 passenger terminals. China is the port's number one import country, and Honduras is the number one export country. Miami has the world's largest amount of cruise line headquarters, home to: Carnival Cruise Lines , Celebrity Cruises , Norwegian Cruise Line , Oceania Cruises , and Royal Caribbean International . In 2014, the Port of Miami Tunnel was completed and will serve the PortMiami. [143] Public transportation The Miami Metrorail is the city's rapid transit system and connects the city's central core with its outlying suburbs Tri-Rail is Miami's commuter rail that runs north-south from Miami's suburbs in West Palm Beach to Miami International Airport . Main article: Miami-Dade Transit 

Public transportation in Miami is operated by Miami-Dade Transit and SFRTA , and includes commuter rail ( Tri-Rail ), heavy-rail rapid transit ( Metrorail ), an elevated people mover ( Metromover ), and buses ( Metrobus ). Miami has Florida's highest transit ridership as about 17% of Miamians use transit on a daily basis. [144] 

Miami's heavy-rail rapid transit system, Metrorail , is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a 24.4-mile (39.3 km)-long line. Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of Hialeah , Medley , and inner-city Miami with suburban The Roads , Coconut Grove , Coral Gables , South Miami and urban Kendall via the central business districts of Miami International Airport , the Civic Center , and Downtown . A free, elevated people mover , Metromover , operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami , with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell . Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County. 

Tri-Rail , a commuter rail system operated by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), runs from Miami International Airport northward to West Palm Beach , making eighteen stops throughout Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties. 

Construction is currently underway on the Miami Intermodal Center and Miami Central Station , a massive transportation hub servicing Metrorail , Amtrak , Tri-Rail , Metrobus , Greyhound Lines , taxis , rental cars , MIA Mover , private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Completion of the Miami Intermodal Center is expected to be completed by winter 2011, and will serve over 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of Miami Central Station is scheduled to begin service in the spring of 2012, and Phase II in 2013. 

Two new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage. BayLink would connect Downtown with South Beach , and the Miami Streetcar would connect Downtown with Midtown . Rail 

Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak 's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star , both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of Hialeah near the Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the Miami Central Station will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with Metrorail , MIA Mover , Tri-Rail , Miami International Airport , and the Miami Intermodal Center all within the same station closer to Downtown. The station was expected to be completed by 2012, [145] but experienced several delays and was later expected to be completed in late 2014, [146] again pushed back to early 2015. [147] 

Florida High Speed Rail was a proposed government backed high-speed rail system that would have connected Miami, Orlando, and Tampa. The first phase was planned to connect Orlando and Tampa and was offered federal funding, but it was turned down by Governor Rick Scott in 2011. The second phase of the line was envisioned to connect Miami. By 2014, a private project known as All Aboard Florida by a company of the historic Florida East Coast Railway began construction of a higher-speed rail line in South Florida that is planned to eventually terminate at Orlando International Airport . [148] Road The Venetian Causeway (left) and MacArthur Causeway (right) connect Downtown and South Beach , Miami Beach . State Road 886 (Port Boulevard) connects downtown and PortMiami by bridge over Biscayne Bay . 

Miami's road system is based along the numerical "Miami Grid" where Flagler Street forms the east-west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north-south meridian . The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown , which is close to the coast, therefore, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St ), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals. 

With few exceptions, within this grid north/south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east/west roads are Streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways. Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 blocks to each mile on north/south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east/west streets. Major north/south avenues generally end in "7" - e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue. (One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.) Major east/west streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half mile south of Flagler ("zeroth") Street. Thus, major streets are at 8th St. + 16 = 24th St./Coral Way, + 16 = 40th St./Bird, +16 = 56th/Miller, + 16 = 72nd/ Sunset, + 16 = 88th/N. Kendall, + 16 = 104th (originally S. Kendall), + 16 = 120th/Montgomery, + 16 = 136th/Howard, + 16 = 152nd/Coral Reef, + 16 = 168th/Richmond, + 16 = 184th/Eureka, + 16 = 200th/Quail Roost, + 16 = 216th/Hainlin Mill, + 16 = 232nd/Silver Palm, + 16 = 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300's. Within the Grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side. This makes even unfamiliar addresses and distances easy - If one must travel from, say 1709 SW 8th St. to 24832 SW 157th Avenue, one knows it will be 140 blocks (157-17) / 20 miles to the west and 240 blocks (248-8) / 15 miles to the south, and that the destination will be on the south side of 248th St. Remarkably, even Miami natives are often unaware of this pattern. 

All streets and avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the Miami Grid, with a few exceptions, most notably Coral Gables , Hialeah , Coconut Grove and Miami Beach . One neighborhood, The Roads , is thusly named because its streets run off the Miami Grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads. 

Miami-Dade County is served by four Interstate Highways ( I-75 , I-95 , I-195 , I-395 ) and several U.S. Highways including U.S. Route 1 , U.S. Route 27 , U.S. Route 41 , and U.S. Route 441 . 

Some of the major Florida State Roads (and their common names) serving Miami are: SR 112 (Airport Expressway): Interstate 95 to MIA Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (SR 821): Florida's Turnpike mainline (SR 91)/ Miami Gardens to U.S. Route 1 / Florida City SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway): Golden Glades Interchange to U.S. Route 1/ Pinecrest SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway): Downtown to SW 137th Ave via MIA SR 874 (Don Shula Expressway): 826/Bird Road to Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike/ Kendall SR 878 (Snapper Creek Expressway): SR 874/ Kendall to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest South Miami SR 924 (Gratigny Parkway) Miami Lakes to Opa-locka Miami Causeways Name Termini Year built Rickenbacker Causeway Brickell and Key Biscayne 1947 Venetian Causeway Downtown and South Beach 1912–1925 MacArthur Causeway Downtown and South Beach 1920 Julia Tuttle Causeway Wynwood / Edgewater and Miami Beach 1959 79th Street Causeway Upper East Side and North Beach 1929 Broad Causeway North Miami and Bal Harbour 1951 

Miami has six major causeways that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland, with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean. The Rickenbacker Causeway is the southernmost causeway and connects Brickell to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne . The Venetian Causeway and MacArthur Causeway connect Downtown with South Beach . The Julia Tuttle Causeway connects Midtown and Miami Beach . The 79th Street Causeway connects the Upper East Side with North Beach . The northernmost causeway, the Broad Causeway , is the smallest of Miami's six causeways, and connects North Miami with Bal Harbour . 

In 2007, Miami was identified as having the rudest drivers in the United States, the second year in a row to have been cited, in a poll commissioned by automobile club AutoVantage. [149] Miami is also consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States for pedestrians. [150] Bicycling 

In recent years the city government, under Mayor Manny Diaz , has taken an ambitious stance in support of bicycling in Miami for both recreation and commuting. Every month, the city hosts "Bike Miami", where major streets in Downtown and Brickell are closed to automobiles, but left open for pedestrians and bicyclists . The event began in November 2008, and has doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami. This is the longest-running such event in the US. In October 2009, the city also approved an extensive 20-year plan for bike routes and paths around the city. The city has begun construction of bike routes as of late 2009, and ordinances requiring bike parking in all future construction in the city became mandatory as of October 2009. [151] 

In 2010, Miami was ranked as the 44th-most bike-friendly city in the US according to Bicycling Magazine . [152] Walkability 

A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Miami the eighth-most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States, [153] but a 2013 survey by Travel + Leisure ranked Miami 34th for "public transportation and pedestrian friendliness."

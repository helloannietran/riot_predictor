History [ edit ] 

Benton Harbor was founded by Henry C. Morton, Sterne Brunson and Charles Hull, who all now have or have had schools named after them. [9] Benton Harbor was mainly swampland bordered by the Paw Paw River , through which a canal was built, hence the "harbor" in the city's name. [10] In 1860, the village was laid out by Brunson, Morton, Hull and others, and given the name of Brunson Harbor. [11] 

Brunson, Morton, and Hull also donated land and solicited subscriptions for construction of the canal, which was completed in 1862. It had long been recognized that a canal would be crucial to the town's development, both to drain the marsh and to provide a berthing area for ships. The canal, originally 25 feet wide but expanded to 50 feet wide in 1868, led to the town's becoming a shipping and manufacturing center for the area. [12] 

In 1865 the name of the settlement was changed to Benton Harbor in honor of Thomas Hart Benton , a Missouri Senator who helped Michigan achieve statehood. In 1869, Benton Harbor was organized as a village and in 1891 was incorporated as a city. [11] 

Two major riots occurred in 1966 and 2003. Several other riots have also occurred in the intervening period. Geography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 4.68 square miles (12.12 km 2 ), of which 4.43 square miles (11.47 km 2 ) is land and 0.25 square miles (0.65 km 2 ) is water.

The Michigan Treasury Department in 2009 sent a team to look into the city's finances. The team's report was a long list of mismanagement to the point that budgets were "effectively meaningless as a financial management tool." [8] The city was $10 million under- funded in its pension fund and increasing budget deficits. In April 2010, Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm appointed Joseph Harris as Emergency Financial Manager. City staff has been reduced by 30 to 70. [16] Benton Harbor City Hall 

Harris was given expanded powers under a new law signed in March 2011 by Republican Governor Rick Snyder . [1] Harris was previously the chief financial officer for the city of Detroit . [1] On April 14, 2011, Harris suspended the decision-making powers of Benton Harbor's elected city officials, who can hold meetings but are not allowed to govern. [1] The Michigan AFL-CIO president called the move "sad news for democracy in Michigan", but at least one city official, City Commissioner Bryan Joseph, was in favor of it, saying the city had been mismanaged for decades. [1] 

On January 4, 2012, city commissioners Marcus Muhammad and MaryAlice Adams held a press conference, where they stated that if there is still an emergency financial manager administrating the city when Benton Harbor hosts the Senior PGA Championship in May, an " Occupy PGA movement should sit in on the golf greens and driving ranges in protest." [17] 

On January 11, 2013 the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board (ELB) voted to replace Joseph Harris as the Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) for the city of Benton Harbor. On February 1, 2013, the ELB would then appoint Tony R. Saunders II as the youngest Successor-Emergency Financial Manager for the city of Benton Harbor. [18]

Transportation [ edit ] Major highways [ edit ] I-94 bypasses the city to the east and south, connecting with Kalamazoo and Detroit to the east and with Michigan City, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois to the south and southwest. BL I-94 travels through the downtowns of both Benton Harbor and St. Joseph. It mostly follows the former route of US 12 . I‑196 begins nearby in Benton Township and continues northerly toward Holland , ending at Grand Rapids . US 31 is currently a freeway (the St. Joseph Valley Parkway ) from the Indiana border north, until merging with a five-lane road (Napier Avenue) to a brief connection with I-94. A freeway connection directly to I-94 is planned. M-63 serves as a loop route connecting with I-196 at the north and running through downtown St. Joseph. M-63 continues on to I-94 and then to M-139, where it ends. M-63 follows the former route of US 33 . M-139 begins at US 12 near Niles and terminates at BL I-94 on the Benton Harbor–Benton Township border (the northbound direction terminates wholly within Benton Township). M-139 follows a former route of US 31 south of I-94.

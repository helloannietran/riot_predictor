Events [ edit ] 

The protests began on 21 May 2011 when over 10,000 Georgians attended a demonstration in Tbilisi demanding Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili 's resignation. In the southwestern town of Batumi some demonstrations also occurred with some protesters attempting to break into television building. [3] Nino Burjanadze , an ex-parliamentary speaker and leader of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party, has been a lead figure in the demonstrations. [4] The protesters in Batumi briefly clashed with police. [5] 

Burjanadze stated that one of the aims of the protesters was to prevent a parade commemorating Independence Day on 26 May 1918 from taking place in Freedom Square in Tbilisi. [6] On 26 May at about 00:15, Georgian police began to suppress the protests with tear gas and rubber bullets, and the protests soon ended. Burjanadze apparently fled in a motorcade which ran over one protester and one policeman (killing them both; two more bodies later showed up as well, apparently electrocuted by a loose wire). [1] 

On the 28 May, a separate demonstration was held with thousands of participants, protesting against violence both by the protesters and by the police. [1] Arrests [ edit ] 

In early June, Georgian authorities arrested and charged Badri Bitsadze , husband of former parliament speaker Nino Burdzhanadze , with attempting to orchestrate the government takeover using paramilitary groups during the violent anti-government protests. [7] There have been 105 other arrests of protesters. [2] Reactions [ edit ] 

Mikheil Saakashvilli stated that he believed the protestors were backed by Russia , and that they provoked the violence. [2] Likewise, John R. Bass , the American ambassador to Georgia , stated that "here were clearly a number of people included in that protest who were not interested in peacefully protesting, but were looking to spark a violent confrontation." [2] The Georgian Interior Ministry has released video recordings that it claims show opposition members discussing how to instigate clashes with police [2] [8] The Economist , meanwhile, spoke of an attempt by Burjanadze to "claw her way back to power". [1] 

Irakly Alasania , also an opposition leader stated that the protests were doomed to failure because “ The era when politicians can just call people on the streets is over. Georgia is building a new political culture. People want to determine Georgia’s future through elections.

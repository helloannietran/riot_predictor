Everett is the county seat of and the largest city in Snohomish County , Washington , United States . [6] Named for Everett Colby, son of founder Charles L. Colby, [7] it lies 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle . The city had a total population of 103,019 at the 2010 census , making it the 7th largest in the state and fifth-largest in the Puget Sound area. It received an All-America City Award in 2002. 

Everett is home to the largest public marina on the west coast of the United States [8] and is the western terminus of the western segment of U.S. Route 2 . It is also home to Boeing 's assembly plant for the 747 , 767 , 777 and the new 787 . Boeing's Everett facility is known for being the largest building in the world by volume at 116.5 million cubic feet (3,300,000 m 3 ). 

In 1984, Everett was selected as the site of a U.S. Navy Homeport, Naval Station Everett . The Naval Station formally opened in 1992 and on January 8, 1997 welcomed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln . The Lincoln is no longer homeported in Everett as of Winter 2011. The aircraft carrier, USS Nimitz (CVN-68) has replaced the Lincoln as Everett's homeported ship, as of March 9, 2012. Everett is also home to the Port of Everett, an international shipping port that brings trade, commerce, jobs and recreational opportunities to the city. 

In 2003, Xfinity Arena (then known as Everett Events Center) opened Everett to tourism. The $83 million arena continues to host events, once exclusive to Seattle's KeyArena, to the present day. The arena's "Twin Masts" are a signature of the Everett skyline. It hosts events such as concerts, trade shows, hockey ( Everett Silvertips ), and high school graduations. [9] However, as of a June 28, 2016 the arena may be taken over by the City of Everett since the arena has continued to operate in the red since 2011, thus possibly moving up the take over date by the city from 2026 to a sooner date.

History [ edit ] Weyerhaeuser Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s 

The land on which Everett was founded was surrendered to the United States by its original inhabitants under the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott . [11] Permanent settlement in the area by European descendants started in 1861 when Dennis Brigham built a cabin on a 160-acre (0.6 km 2 ) claim on the shore of Port Gardner Bay . Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived. 

On July 17, 1890, The steamship Queen of the Pacific left Tacoma for an Alaskan cruise with Henry Hewitt, Jr. and Charles L. Colby aboard. During this "Fateful voyage" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The Rucker Brothers filed their plat at Port Gardner, a 50-acre (200,000 m 2 ) townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group. 

On September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and Colgate Hoyt . In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator Edward Everett . 

On November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred 434.15 acres (1.7569 km 2 ) of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, "The Remarkable Document" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development. 

The Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the Great Northern Railway came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that James J. Hill would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of Puget Sound to Seattle . Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city. 

Railroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of Monte Cristo depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the Yukon gold rush . 

Several survivors of the Bellingham riots settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the Everett Massacre of 1916 which was an armed confrontation between a mob, led by local Sheriff Donald McRae, and Industrial Workers of the World members. The IWW members were on the steamer Verona and sought to land, but Sheriff McRae denied them his permission. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW's were killed and two in the Sheriff's mob were killed, though they might have been accidentally shot by others in their allegedly drunken group. 

Everett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the BNSF Railway tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge Hiram Bond , President of the Everett Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, John D. Rockefeller , railroad executive T.F. Oakes , shipbuilder Alexander McDougall , and McDougall's associate Charles W. Wetmore . Geography [ edit ] Topography [ edit ] 

Everett is located at 47°" West (47.963434, -122.200527). [12] The city is one of the core cities comprising the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia CMSA . 

The core of Everett sits on the Port Gardner Peninsula, formed by Port Gardner Bay on the west and the Snohomish River to the north and east. Newer portions of the city generally extend southward from this point for a distance of approximately 8 miles (13 km). 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 48.49 square miles (125.59 km 2 ), of which, 33.45 square miles (86.64 km 2 ) is land and 15.04 square miles (38.95 km 2 ) is water.

The climate of Everett is heavily influenced by marine air masses, which tend to moderate temperatures with seasonal variations much less pronounced than inland areas. Due to a drying trend in the summer months, Everett has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) according to the Köppen climate classification system.

Waterfront [ edit ] View from Everett Yacht Club on Port Gardner Wharf 

Situated at the mouth of the Snohomish River on Possession Sound , the Everett waterfront is home to Naval Station Everett and the Port of Everett (est. 1918). The Port of Everett includes both a deep-water commercial seaport and a marina with over 2,000 slips, which it claims to be the largest on the west coast of the United States. [14] Ambitious redevelopment began in 2006 to convert the north end of the waterfront into a community of maritime businesses, retail shops and condominiums, beginning with the Port of Everett's Port Gardner Wharf. In 2006, the seaport received 119 ships and 59 barges, totaling some 192,000 short tons of cargo. [15] 

The waterfront is also home to the Everett Yacht Club, which was founded in 1907, although it existed in some form as early as 1895. [16] During summer months, the marina is home to the Everett Farmer's Market (Sundays) and the Waterfront Concert Series (Thursday nights), part of a citywide free concert series which, in 2006, attracted over 26,000 visitors. [17] Each September, Tenth Street Park on the waterfront is home to the annual Everett Coho Derby, [18] while each August the marina promenade is gowned in local art during the Fresh Paint Festival of Artists.

Jetty Island is a man-made island and park located in the Puget Sound , just off the Everett, Washington waterfront. The island is two miles long and half a mile wide, approximately 1,800 acres. The island has no plumbing, electricity or structures. During the summer months, a ferry becomes operational, allowing transportation to and from the island. A floating restroom also becomes operational off the island's shore. Jetty Island's unique features provide excellent habitat for birds and juvenile salmon. The island is home to more than 45 bird species including osprey, shorebirds, hawks, eagles, cormorants and ducks. Visitors may see seals surfacing or lounging near the water's edge, or even witness gray whales swimming past during spring migration. [21] [22] Nishiyama Garden [ edit ]

Since the end of the Great Recession (2009), Seattle has seen its cost of living rise exponentially, largely due to large-scale economic development and the growth of the tech industry. [39] As its perception as a working class community has diminished, [40] many musicians and artists have found it increasingly difficult to live within Seattle proper. [41] This has led to an "artistic flight" toward neighboring communities, most notably Everett which is often cited as possessing the "true grit and soul of the 90's." [42] [43] Libraries [ edit ] 

The historically and architecturally significant Everett Public Library is a cornerstone of Everett's downtown and a beacon to its citizens.

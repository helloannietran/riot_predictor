Odisha ( pronunciation: i / ə ˈ d ɪ s ə / ; [5] ) or Orissa [6] [7] ( / ɒ ˈ r ɪ s ə , ɔː - , oʊ - / ; [8] Odia : ଓଡ଼ିଶା ) is one of the 29 states of India , located in the eastern coast. It is surrounded by the states of West Bengal to the north-east, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west and north-west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south and south-west. Odisha has 485 kilometres (301 mi) of coastline along the Bay of Bengal on its east, from Balasore to Malkangiri . [9] It is the 9th largest state by area , and the 11th largest by population . Odia (formerly known as Oriya ) [10] is the official and most widely spoken language, spoken by 33.2 million according to the 2001 Census. [11] 

The ancient kingdom of Kalinga , which was invaded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War , coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha. [12] The modern state of Orissa was established on 1 April 1936, as a province in British India , and consisted predominantly of Odia-speaking regions. [12] April 1 is celebrated as Odisha Day . [13] The region is also known as Utkala and is mentioned in India's national anthem, " Jana Gana Mana ". [14] Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135, [15] after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha. [16]

Etymology [ edit ] See also: History of Odisha § Historical names of Odisha 

The term "Odisha" is derived from the ancient Prakrit word "Odda Visaya" (also " Udra Bibhasha" or " Odra Bibhasha" ) as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I , which is dated to 1025. [17] Sarala Das , who translated the Mahabharata into the Odia language in the 15th century, calls the region Odra Rashtra and Odisha . The inscriptions of Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati Kingdom (1435–67) on the walls of temples in Puri call the region Odisha or Odisha Rajya . [18] 

The name of the state was changed from Orissa to Odisha, and the name of its language from Oriya to Odia, in 2011, by the passage of the Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2010 and the Constitution (113th Amendment) Bill, 2010 in the Parliament . After a brief debate, the lower house, Lok Sabha , passed the bill and amendment on 9 November 2010. [19] On 24 March 2011, Rajya Sabha , the upper house of Parliament, also passed the bill and the amendment. [20] History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Odisha and Historic sites in Odisha Lingaraja Temple built by the Somavanshi king Jajati Keshari 

Prehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans. [21] Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like Mahabharata , Vayu Purana and Mahagovinda Suttanta . [22] [23] The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata. [24] [25] Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions. [26] Hathigumpha on the Udayagiri Hills built in c. 150 BCE Shanti Stupa at Dhauli 

Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE, [27] which was the eighth year of his reign. [28] According to his own edicts , in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and several more were affected. [27] The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism. [28] [29] 

By c. 150 CE, emperor Kharavela , who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria , [30] conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill. [31] Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta [32] and Shashanka . [33] It was also a part of Harsha 's empire. [34] 

Later, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar . [12] They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty . Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga , who began construction on the present-day Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I , who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250). [35] [36] 

The Eastern Ganga Dynasty was followed by the Gajapati Kingdom . The region resisted integration into the Mughal empire until 1568, when it was conquered by Sultanate of Bengal . [37] Mukunda Deva, who is considered the last independent king of Kalinga, was defeated and was killed in battle by a rebel Ramachandra Bhanja. Ramachandra Bhanja himself was killed by Bayazid Khan Karrani . [38] In 1591, Man Singh I , then governor of Bihar , led an army to take Odisha from the Karranis of Bengal . They agreed to treaty because their leader Qutlu Khan Lohani had recently died. But, they then broke the treaty by attacking the temple town of Puri . Man Singh returned in 1592 and pacified the region. [39] In 1751, the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan ceded the region to the Maratha Empire . [12] 

The British had occupied the Northern Circars comprising the southern coast of Odisha as a result of the 2nd Carnatic War by 1760, and incorporated them into the Madras Presidency gradually. [40] In 1803, the British ousted the Marathas from the Puri-Cuttack region of Odisha during the Second Anglo-Maratha War . The northern and western districts of Odisha were incorporated into the Bengal Presidency . [41] 

The Orissa famine of 1866 caused an estimated 1 million deaths. [42] Following this, large-scale irrigation projects were undertaken. [43] In 1903, the Utkal Sammilani organisation was founded to demand the unification of Odia-speaking regions into one state. [44] On 1 April 1912, the Bihar and Orissa Province was formed. [45] On 1 April 1936, Bihar and Orissa were split into separate provinces. [46] The new province of Orissa came into existence on a linguistic basis during the British rule in India, with Sir John Austen Hubback as the first governor. [46] [47] Following India's independence , on 15 August 1947, 27 princely states signed the document to join Orissa. [48] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Odisha Mahanadi river near Cuttack Satellite view of the Mahanadi river delta 

Odisha lies between the latitudes 17.780N and 22.730N, and between longitudes 81.37E and 87.53E. The state has an area of 155,707 km 2 , which is 4.87% of total area of India, and a coastline of 450 km. [49] In the eastern part of the state lies the coastal plain. It extends from the Subarnarekha River in the north to the Rushikulya river in the south. The lake Chilika is part of the coastal plains. The plains are rich in fertile silt deposited by the six major rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal : Subarnarekha , Budhabalanga , Baitarani , Brahmani , Mahanadi and Rushikulya . [49] The Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), a Food and Agriculture Organization -recognised rice gene bank and research institute, is situated on the banks of Mahanadi in Cuttack . [50] Three-quarters of the state is covered in mountain ranges. Deep and broad valleys have been made in them by rivers. These valleys have fertile soil and are densely populated. Odisha also has plateaus and rolling uplands , which have lower elevation than the plateaus. [49] The highest point in the state is Deomali at 1672 metres. The other high peaks are: Sinkaram (1620 m), Golikoda (1617 m), and Yendrika (1582 metres). [51] Climate [ edit ] 

The state experiences four meteorological seasons : winter (January to February), pre-monsoon season (March to May), south-west monsoon season (June to September) and north east monsoon season (October–December). However, locally the year is divided into six traditional seasons (or rutus ): Basanta (spring), Grishma (summer), Barsha (rainy season), Sharad (autumn), Hemant (winter), and Shishir (cool season).

According to a Forest Survey of India report released in 2012, Odisha has 48,903 km 2 of forests which cover 31.41% of the state's total area. The forests are classified into: dense forest (7,060 km 2 ), medium dense forest (21,366 km 2 ), open forest (forest without closed canopy ; 20,477 km 2 ) and scrub forest (4,734 km 2 ). The state also has bamboo forests (10,518 km 2 ) and mangroves (221 km 2 ). The state is losing its forests to timber smuggling , mining , industrialisation and grazing . There have been attempts at conservation and reforestation . [54] 

Due to the climate and good rainfall, Odisha's evergreen and moist forests are suitable habitats for wild orchids . Around 130 species have been reported from the state. [55] 97 of them are found in Mayurbhanj district alone. The Orchid House of Nandakanan Biological Park hosts some of these species. [56] 

Simlipal National Park is a protected wildlife area and tiger reserve spread over 2750 km 2 of the northern part of Mayurbhanj district . It has 1078 species of plants, including 94 orchids. The sal tree is the primary tree species there. The park has 55 mammals, including barking deer , Bengal tiger , common langur , four-horned antelope , Indian bison , Indian elephant , Indian giant squirrel , Indian leopard , jungle cat , sambar deer , and wild boar . There are 304 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna , grey hornbill , Indian pied hornbill and Malabar pied hornbill . It has also has 60 species of reptiles, notable among which are the king cobra and tricarinate hill turtle . There is also a mugger crocodile breeding program in nearby Ramtirtha. [57] The Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km 2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests and are driving herds of elephants to migration. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants. But by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district , and Athagad . Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration from being electrocuted by power lines or hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by poachers . [58] [59] Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has Indian leopards , jungle cats and chitals . [60] 

The Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district covers 650 km 2 , of which 150 km 2 are mangroves. The Gahirmatha beach in Bhitarkanika is the world's largest nesting site for olive ridley sea turtles . [61] Other major nesting grounds for the turtle in the state are Rushikulya , in Ganjam district , [62] and the mouth of the Devi river . [63] The Bhitarkanika sanctuary is also noted for its large population of salt-water crocodiles . [64] In winter, the sanctuary is also visited by migratory birds. Among the species of birds spotted in the sanctuary are the black-crowned night heron , darter , grey heron , Indian cormorant , Oriental white ibis , purple heron , and sarus crane . [65] The possibly endangered horseshoe crab is also found in this region. [66] 

Chilika Lake is a brackish water lagoon on the east coast of Odisha with an area of 1105 km 2 . It is connected to the Bay of Bengal by a 35-km-long narrow channel and is a part of the Mahanadi delta. In the dry season, the tides bring in salt water. In the rainy season, the rivers falling into the lagoon decrease its salinity. [67] Birds from places like the Caspian Sea , Lake Baikal , other parts of Russia , Central Asia , South-East Asia , Ladakh and the Himalayas migrate to the lagoon in winter. [68] Among the birds spotted there are Eurasian wigeon , pintail , bar-headed goose , greylag goose , flamingo , mallard and Goliath heron . [69] [70] The lagoon also has a small population of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins . [71] The state's coastal region has also had sightings of finless porpoise , bottlenose dolphin , humpback dolphin and spinner dolphin in its waters. [72] Government and politics [ edit ] Odisha State Secretariat building in Bhubaneswar Main article: Government of Odisha 

All states in India are governed by a parliamentary system of government based on universal adult franchise . [73] India's parliament is bicameral . [74] The lower house is called the Lok Sabha . Odisha contributes 21 members to Lok Sabha. They are directly elected by the electorates . The upper house is called the Rajya Sabha . Odisha contributes 10 members to Rajya Sabha. They are elected by the state's legislature. [2] [75] 

The main parties active in the politics of Odisha are the Biju Janata Dal , the Indian National Congress and Bhartiya Janata Party ,CPI(M). Following the Odisha State Assembly Election in 2014 , the Naveen Patnaik -led Biju Janata Dal stayed in power for the fourth consecutive term. [76] Legislative assembly [ edit ] Main articles: Odisha Legislative Assembly and Vidhan Sabha 

The Odisha state has an unicameral legislature. [74] The Odisha Legislative Assembly consists of 147 elected members, [76] and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker , or by the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. [77] Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister , although the titular head of government is the Governor of Odisha . The Governor is appointed by the President of India . The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. [78] The 147 elected representatives are called Members of the Legislative Assembly , or MLAs. One MLA may be nominated from the Anglo-Indian community by the Governor. [79] The term of the office is for 5 years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. [77] Administrative units [ edit ] Main article: List of districts of Odisha 

There are 30 districts in Odisha — Angul , Balangir , Balasore , Bargarh , Bhadrak , Boudh , Cuttack , Deogarh , Dhenkanal , Gajapati , Ganjam , Jagatsinghpur , Jajpur , Jharsuguda , Kandhamal , Kalahandi , Kendrapara , Keonjhar , Khordha , Koraput , Malkangiri , Mayurbhanj , Nabarangpur , Nayagarh , Nuapada , Puri , Rayagada , Sambalpur , Subarnapur , Sundargarh .

These 30 districts have been placed under three different revenue divisions to streamline their governance. The divisions are North, South and Central, with their headquarters at Sambalpur , Berhampur and Cuttack respectively. Each division consists of 10 districts, and has as its administrative head a Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC). [81] The position of the RDC in the administrative hierarchy is that between that of the district administration and the state secretariat. [82] The RDCs report to the Board of Revenue, which is headed by a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service .

Each district is governed by a District Collector , who is appointed from the Indian Administrative Service . [83] [84] The Collector is responsible for collecting the revenue and maintaining law and order in the district. Each district is separated into sub-divisions, each governed by a sub-divisional collectors and sub-divisional magistrates. The sub-divisions are further divided into revenue blocks called tehsils . The tehshils are headed by Tehsildars. Odisha has 58 Sub-Divisions and 317 Tehsils. [81] Blocks consists of Panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. 

The capital and largest city of the state is Bhubaneswar . The other major cities are Berhampur , Cuttack , Rourkela , and Sambalpur . Municipal Corporations in Odisha include Bhubaneswar , Cuttack , Sambalpur , Berhampur and Rourkela .

Odisha is experiencing steady economic growth. The impressive growth in gross domestic product of the state has been reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Odisha's growth rate is above the national average. [85] The central Government's Urban Development Ministry has recently announced the names of 20 cities selected to be developed as smart cities. The state capital Bhubaneswar is the first city in the list of smart Cities released in January 2016, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The announcement also marked with sanction of Rs 50,802 crore over the five years for development. [86] Industrial growth [ edit ] 

Odisha has abundant natural resources and a large coastline. Odisha has emerged as the most preferred destination for overseas investors with investment proposals. [87] It contains a fifth of India's coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite . Rourkela Steel Plant [88] was the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, built with collaboration of Germany. It is the home to public sector enterprises like HAL, Sunabeda (Koraput), NALCO (Anugul in Angul District, Damanjodi in Koraput). Odisha receives unprecedented investments in steel, aluminium, power, refineries and ports. India's topmost IT consulting firms, including Tata Consultancy Services , Tech Mahindra , Infosys , Mindtree , Wipro and PricewaterhouseCoopers have large branches in Odisha. IBM and Syntel are setting up development centres in Odisha. So far, two of the S P CNX 500 conglomerates have corporate offices in Odisha, for example, National Aluminium (2005 gross income ₹ .51,162 million) and Tata Sponge Iron (2005 gross income ₹ .2,044 million). Odisha is notable as one of the first Indian states to have tackled its structural problems during the post-1994 Indian economic reforms. Odisha was also the first state in India to begin to privatise its electricity transmission and distribution businesses. Between 1994 and 2000 Odisha's former state electricity board (SEB) was restructured to form Gridco. This corporation was then divided into Transco and a collection of distribution companies. Attempts were then made to sell the distribution companies to the private sector. The scale and importance of these reforms is notable and an important milestone in India's dramatic economic development. Rourkela Steel Plant 

Recently the number of companies who have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) to set up steel plants in the state has gone up to 50, including POSCO of South Korea, which has agreed to construct a mammoth $12 billion steel plant near Paradip port, named POSCO India . It would be the largest single investment in India's history. Arcelor-Mittal has also announced plans to invest in another mega steel project amounting to $10 billion. Russian major Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Company (MMK) plans to set up a 10 MT steel plant in Odisha, too. Bandhabahal is a major area of open cast coal mines in Odisha. The state is attracting an unprecedented amount of investment in aluminium, coal-based power plants, petrochemicals, and information technology as well. In power generation, Reliance Power (Anil Ambani Group) is putting up the world's largest power plant with an investment of US $13 billion at Hirma in Jharsuguda district . [89] Vedanta Resources ’ 1.4 million tonne alumina project in Kalahandi district is the largest investment in aluminium. Vedanta has also announced a $3.2 billion huge private University project on the lines of major American universities, which is unprecedented in the history of education in India. The central government has agreed to accord SEZ ( Special Economic Zone ) status to eight sites in Odisha, among which are Infocity at Bhubaneshwar and Paradip. But all these plans are facing massive resistance from the people of the state who mainly depend on agriculture for their livelihood. 

In the year 2009 Odisha was the second top domestic investment destination with Gujarat first and Andhra Pradesh in third place according to an analysis of ASSOCHAM Investment Meter (AIM) study on corporate investments. Odisha's share was 12.6 percent in total investment in the country. It received investment proposal worth ₹ . 2,00,846 crore during the last year. Steel and power were among the sectors which attracted maximum investments in the state. [90] Flood and cyclone are the major hurdles in Odisha's development as the important districts are situated near to the Bay of Bengal. In the five-year period between 2004 and 2005 and 2008–09, Odisha's GDP has grown by a stunning 8.74% way beyond the definition of 7% growth. It should be noted that the all-India growth during this period was 8.49%. In this period, Odisha was the fourth fastest growing state, just behind Gujarat, Bihar , Uttarakhand . Infrastructure development [ edit ] 

Paradip Port on the Bay of Bengal is one of the major port on the east coast of India, the coastal towns of Dhamra and Gopalpur are also two of the other major ports in Odisha. The government of India has selected the coastal region of Odisha, stretching from Paradip in the north to Gopalpur in the south, to be developed into one of five or six Special Economic Regions (SERs) of the country. The government of India and the state government of Odisha are working together to erect world-class infrastructure in this region to match that of Rotterdam , Houston , and Pudong . This is aimed at further private investment in petrochemicals, steel, and manufacturing. A recent Morgan Stanley report forecasts that Odisha would be flooded with massive investments for manufacturing related activities in the same manner that Bangalore had attracted software investment in the 1990s. The scale of the investments in Odisha would, however, be much higher. 

As of July 2006, total planned investment in the state was $90 billion. This includes investment in research, education, hospitals, roads, ports, airports, and hotels. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including the Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects . 14 locations have been identified on Odisha's coast to be developed as ports: Gopalpur (Ganjam district), Bahuda Muhan (Sonepur) in Ganjam district, Palur (Ganjam), Bali Harchandi (Puri), Astaranga (Puri), Jatadhari Muhan (Jagatsinghpur), Barunei Muhan (Kendrapara), Dhamra (Bhadrak), Chudamani (Bhadrak), Inchuri (Balasore), Chandipur (Balasore), Bahabalpur (Balasore), Subarnarekha mouth (Kirtania) in Balasore district and Talsara (Balasore). Most of them have already been developing as ports in the public private partnership (PPP). [91] [92] [93] Transportation [ edit ] Malatipatpur Bus Stand, Puri

[114] Odissi has a long, unbroken tradition of 2,000 years, and finds mention in the Natyashastra of Bharatamuni , possibly written c. 200 BC. However, the dance form nearly became extinct during the British period, only to be revived after India's independence by a few gurus. 

The variety of dances includes Ghumura Dance , Chhau dance , Mahari dance , and Gotipua . Cinema [ edit ] Main article: Cinema of Odisha 

The cinema of Odisha is famous throughout India and growing every year by a large margin as people are liking Ollywood movies now. After the first Odia film Sita Bibaha in 1936, only two films were produced till 1951. A joint consortium of landlords and businessmen who collected funds after 1948 produced those two movies. Sita Bibaha was directed by Mohan Sunder Dev Goswami and was released in Laxmi Theatre, Puri. The 1951 production Roles to Eight was the first Odia film with an English name. It was released after 15 years after Sita Bibaha . It was the fourth Odia film produced by Ratikanta Padhi. The eleventh Odia film Sri Lokenath was the first Odia film that got a National Award in 1960; it was directed by Prafulla Sengupta. 

One of the major trailblazers and pioneers of the Odia film industry were Gour Prasad Ghose and his wife, Parbati Ghose. They introduced and mastered innovative ways of technical storytelling. Over the years, some of their most notable films such as Maa and Kaa brought them national fame and numerous awards, including many National and lifetime achievement awards for their contribution to cinema as directors, producers and actors. 

The same year, Prasant Nanda won a National Award as best actor for Nua Bou , his debut film. The name of Prasant Nanda always comes up when dealing with the Odia film industry. He was present in Odia films since 1939, but he became active only after 1976. Nanda served Ollywood as an actor, director, screenplay writer, lyricist and even as a playback singer. Such a versatile genius is quite rare in Indian cinema history. Nanda alone carried Odia films into the national honour list by winning National Awards three times in 1960, 1966 and 1969 for his acting in Nua Bou , Matira Manisha and Adina Megha . 

Uttam Mohanty , whose debut film Abhiman won accolades all over, is now the veteran actor of the Odia film industry. His wife Aparajita Mohanty is a renowned actress.

His popular films are Nua Bou , Jeevan Sathi , Sadhana , Manika Jodi , Naba Janma , Matira Manisa , Arundhati , Ghara Sansara , Bhookha , etc. His films portrayed the general condition of the state of Odisha with a strong social message. Sarat Pujari is a prominent figure. Apart from being an actor, he was also a successful director and an academician. He continues to act in a few select films; he is enjoying his retired life and writes columns in the newspapers as his hobby. Raju Mishra is another rising star in Odia film industry.

Other well-known actors are Bijay Mohanty , Sriram Panda , Mihir Das , Siddhanta Mahapatra , Mahasweta Ray , Tandra Ray , Anubhav Mohanty and Babushan Mohanty . Music [ edit ] Main article: Odissi music Konark Sun Temple built by the Eastern Ganga dynasty is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 

The 16th century witnessed the compilation of literature on music. The four important treatises written during that time are Sangitamava Chandrika, Natya Manorama, Sangita Kalalata and Gita Prakasha. Odissi music is a combination of four distinctive kinds of music, namely, Chitrapada, Dhruvapada, Panchal and Chitrakala. When music uses artwork, it is known as Chitikala. A unique feature of Odia music is the Padi, which consists of singing of words in fast beat. 

Being a part of the rich culture of Odisha, its music is also as much charming and colourful. Odissi music is more than two thousand five hundred years old and comprises a number of categories. Of these, the five broad ones are tribal music, folk music , light music, light-classical music and classical music. Anyone who is trying to understand the culture of Odisha must take into account its music, which essentially forms a part of its legacy. 

In the ancient times, there were poets who wrote the lyrics of poems and songs that were sung to rouse the religious feelings of people. It was by the 11th century that the music of Odisha, in the form of Triswari, Chatuhswari, and Panchaswari, underwent transformation and was converted into the classical style. 

Folk music like Jhumar, Yogi Gita, Kendara Gita, Dhuduki Badya, Prahallad Natak, Palla, Sankirtan, Mogal Tamasa, Gitinatya, Kandhei Nacha, Kela Nacha, Ghoda Nacha, Danda Nacha and Daskathia are popular in Odisha. Almost every tribal group has their own unique distinct songs and dance styles in Odisha. 

The anthem of Odisha is " Bande Utkala Janani " (de facto) written by Kantakabi Laxmikanta Mohapatra. When Odisha became independent on 1 April 1936, this poem was made the state anthem of Odisha. 

Apart from these Sambalpuri Songs are very famous in the state as well as neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Chattishgarh etc. Some of them like "Rangabati" and "Ekda Ekda" are famous worldwide. Structural art [ edit ] 

Other cultural attractions include the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, known for its annual Rath Yatra or Car Festival, the unique and beautiful applique artwork of Pipili, silver filigree ornamental works from Cuttack, the Patta chitras (palm leaf paintings), famous stone utensils of Nilgiri (Balasore) and various tribal influenced cultures. The Sun temple at Konark is famous for its architectural splendour and erotic sculpture , while the 'Sambalpuri textiles' equals it in its artistic grandeur. The sari of Odisha is much in demand throughout the entire world. The different colours and varieties of sarees in Odisha make them very popular among the women of the state. The handloom sarees available in Odisha can be of four major types; these are Ikat, Bandha, Bomkai and Pasapalli. Odisha sarees are also available in other colours like cream, maroon, brown and rust. The tie-and-dye technique used by the weavers of Odisha to create motifs on these sarees is unique to this region. This technique also gives the sarees of Odisha an identity of their own.

There is Dhauli with a large statue of Buddha which brings international Buddhist tourists to Odisha. 

Odisha's varying topography – from the wooded Eastern Ghats to the fertile river basin – has proven ideal for evolution of compact and unique ecosystems. This creates treasure troves of flora and fauna that are inviting to many migratory species of birds and reptiles. Bhitarkanika National Park is famous for its second largest mangrove ecosystem. The bird sanctuary in Chilika Lake (Asia's largest brackish water lake) and the tiger reserve and waterfalls in Simlipal National Park are integral parts eco- tourism in Odisha , arranged by Odisha Tourism.

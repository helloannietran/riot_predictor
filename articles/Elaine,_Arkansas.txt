History [ edit ] See also: Elaine Race Riot 

In 1919, two whites tried to break up a meeting of black sharecroppers who were trying organize a farmers' union to get better conditions of payment and accounting from white landowners of cotton plantations. After a white man was killed, hundreds of other whites poured into the area, attacking blacks. Governor Charles Hillman Brough requested federal troops to stop what was called the Elaine Race Riot . White mobs spread throughout the county, and an estimated 237 blacks were killed, and five whites. The governor accompanied the troops to the scene; their use had been approved by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson . Sharecroppers generally remained at a disadvantage in dealing with white landowners. 

At 6:15 PM, April 26, 2011, a tornado – part of the April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak – hit the Elaine area. [2] The tornado was classified as an EF-0 , with estimated wind speeds of 75 miles per hour (121 km/h; 65 kn). [2] The tornado's path of destruction was 200 yards (180 m) wide and the tornado travelled a path of 21.5 miles (34.6 km) along Highway 61 and across the Mississippi state line, ending near Lula, Mississippi . [2] Most of the tornado's damage was concentrated in Friars Point and Coahoma , Mississippi. [2] Geography [ edit ]

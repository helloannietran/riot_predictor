Nagpur ( Marathi नागपूर pronunciation ( help · info ) ) is the winter capital and the third largest city of the Indian state of Maharashtra [13] and largest city of central India. It has one of the highest literacy rate of 91.92% among all the urban agglomerations in India [14] and one of the proposed Smart Cities from Maharashtra. [15] 

Nagpur is the seat of the annual winter session of the Maharashtra state assembly, "Vidhan Sabha" . It is a major commercial and political centre of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra . In addition, the city derives political importance from being the headquarters for the Hindu nationalist organisation RSS and an important location for the Dalit Buddhist movement . 

According to a survey by ABP News - Ipsos , Nagpur has been identified as the best city in India by topping the liveability , greenery, public transport , and health care indices. [16] [17] [18] The city has been adjudged as the 20th cleanest city in India and the top mover in the western zone as per Swachh Sarvekshan 2016 . [19] 

It is famous for the Nagpur Orange and is known as the "Orange City" for being a major trade centre of oranges cultivated in the region. [20] 

The city was founded by the Gonds and later became a part of the Maratha Empire under the royal Bhonsale dynasty. The British East India Company took over Nagpur in the 19th century and made it the capital of the Central Provinces and Berar . After the first reorganisation of states, the city lost its status as the capital. Following the informal " Nagpur Pact " between political leaders, it was made the second capital of Maharashtra. 

Nagpur is also called the "Tiger Capital of India" [21] [22] as it connects many tiger reserves in India to the world. It is among the important cities for the information technology sector in Maharashtra. Nagpur is located in the centre of the country with the Zero Mile marker indicating the geographical centre of India. [23]

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Nagpur 

Also see: Nagpur state Etymology [ edit ] 

One of the earlier names of Nagpur was "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the 'Fana' or hood of a cobra . In fact, Nagpur's first newspaper was named 'Fanindramani', which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that lights up the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper. [24] The river Nag flows through the city. B. R. Ambedkar claimed that both the city and the river are named after "Nag people". [25] The word "pur" means "city" in many Indian languages. [26] During British rule, the name of the city was spelt and pronounced as "Nagpore". [27] Early and medieval history [ edit ] 

In the 18th century, this city was created by leader of Gond tribes named Bhakt Buland (Raja Buland Shah) in the first half of the century. Human existence around present-day Nagpur can be traced back 3000 years to the 8th century BCE. Mehir burial sites at Drugdhamna (near the Mhada colony) indicate that the megalithic culture existed around Nagpur and is still followed. [28] The first reference to the name "Nagpur" is found in a 10th-century copper-plate inscription discovered at Devali in the neighbouring Wardha district. The inscription is a record of grant of a village situated in the visaya (district) of Nagpura-Nandivardhana during the time of the Rastrakuta king Krsna III in the Saka year 862 (940 CE). [29] Towards the end of the 3rd century, King Vindhyasakti is known to have ruled the Nagpur region. In the 4th century, the Vakataka Dynasty ruled over the Nagpur region and surrounding areas and had good relations with the Gupta Empire . The Vakataka king Prithvisena I moved his capital to Nagardhan (ancient name Nandivardhana), 28 kilometres (17 mi) from Nagpur. [30] After the Vakatakas, the region came under the rule of the Hindu kingdoms of the Badami Chalukyas , the Rashtrakutas , and finally the Yadavas . In 1296, Allauddin Khilji invaded the Yadava Kingdom after capturing Deogiri , after which the Tughlaq Dynasty came to power in 1317. In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire conquered the region. However, regional administration was carried out by the Gond kingdom of Deogarh-Nagpur in the Chhindwara district of the modern-day state of Madhya Pradesh . [31] Modern history [ edit ] 

The next Raja (king) of Deogarh was Chand Sultan, who resided principally in the country below the hills, fixing his capital at Nagpur, which he turned into a walled town. On Chand Sultan's death in 1739, Wali Shah, an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, usurped the throne and Chand Sultan's widow invoked the aid of the Maratha leader Raghoji Bhonsale of Berar in the interest of her sons Akbar Shah and Burhan Shah. The usurper was put to death and the rightful heirs placed on the throne. After 1743, a series of Maratha rulers came to power, starting with Raghoji Bhonsale , who conquered the territories of Deogarh, Chanda and Chhattisgarh by 1751. [32] 

Nagpur was burnt substantially in 1765 and again partially in 1811 by marauding Pindaris . However, the development of city of Nagpur continued. [33] In 1803 Raghoji II Bhonsale joined the Peshwa against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War , but the British prevailed. After Raghoji II's death in 1816, his son Parsaji was deposed and murdered by Mudhoji II Bhonsale . Despite the fact that he had entered into a treaty with the British in the same year, Mudhoji joined the Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1817 against the British but suffered a defeat at Sitabuldi in present-day Nagpur city. The fierce battle was a turning point as it laid the foundations of the downfall of the Bhonsales and paved the way for the British acquisition of Nagpur city. [34] Mudhoji was deposed after a temporary restoration to the throne, after which the British placed Raghoji III Bhonsale , the grandchild of Raghoji II , on the throne. During the rule of Raghoji III(which lasted till 1840), the region was administered by a British resident. In 1853, the British took control of Nagpur after Raghoji III died without leaving an heir. [35] Map of Nagpur district with major towns and rivers. Central Provinces and Berar, 1903. Princely states are shown in yellow. 

From 1853 to 1861, the Nagpur Province (which consisted of the present Nagpur region, Chhindwara , and Chhattisgarh ) became part of the Central Provinces and Berar and came under the administration of a commissioner under the British central government, with Nagpur as its capital. Berar was added in 1903. [36] The advent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIP) in 1867 spurred its development as a trade centre. [37] Tata group started the country's first textile mill at Nagpur, formally known as Central India Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. The company was popularly known as "Empress Mills" as it was inaugurated on 1 January 1877, the day queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India. [38] 

The non-co-operation movement was launched in the Nagpur session of 1920. [39] The city witnessed a Hindu–Muslim riot in 1923 which had profound impact on K. B. Hedgewar , [40] who in 1925 founded the RSS , a Hindu nationalist organisation in Nagpur with an idea of creating a Hindu nation . After the 1927 Nagpur riots RSS gained further popularity in Nagpur and the organisation grew nationwide. [41] After Indian independence [ edit ] 

After Indian Independence in 1947, Central Provinces and Berar became a province of India and in 1950 became the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh , again with Nagpur as its capital. [42] When the Indian states were re-organised along the linguistic lines in 1956, Nagpur and Berar regions were transferred to Bombay state , which in 1960 was split between the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat . [43] At a formal public ceremony on 14 October 1956 in Nagpur B. R. Ambedkar with his supporters converted to Buddhism starting Dalit Buddhist movement which is still active. [44] In 1994, the city witnessed its most violent day in modern times in form of the Gowari stampede deaths . [45] 

Nagpur completed 300 years of establishment in the year 2002. A big celebration was organised to mark the event.

Nagpur is located at the exact centre of the Indian peninsula . The city has a Zero Mile stone locating the geographical centre of India, which was used by the British to measure all distances within the Indian subcontinent. 

The city lies on the Deccan plateau of the Indian Peninsula and has a mean altitude of 310.5 meters above sea level. [47] The underlying rock strata are covered with alluvial deposits resulting from the flood plain of the Kanhan River. In some places these give rise to granular sandy soil. In low-lying areas, which are poorly drained, the soil is alluvial clay with poor permeability characteristics. In the eastern part of the city, crystalline metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist and granites are found, while in the northern part yellowish sand stones and clays of the lower Gondwana formations are found. [48] Nagpur city is dotted with natural and artificial lakes. The largest lake is Ambazari Lake . Other natural lakes include Gorewada Lake and Telangkhedi lake. Sonegaon and Gandhisagar Lakes are artificial, created by the city's historical rulers. [49] Nag river, Pilli Nadi, and nallas form the natural drainage pattern for the city. [50] Nagpur is known for its greenery and was adjudged the cleanest and second greenest in India after Chandigarh in 2010. [51] Climate [ edit ] 

Nagpur has tropical savannah climate ( Köppen climate classification ) with dry conditions prevailing for most of the year. It receives about 163 mm of rainfall in June. The amount of rainfall is increased in July to 294 mm. Gradual decrease of rainfall has been observed from July to August (278 mm) and September (160 mm). [47] The highest recorded daily rainfall was 304 mm on 14 July 1994. [52] Summers are extremely hot, lasting from March to June, with May being the hottest month.

[57] Administration [ edit ] Vidhan Bhavan Second Capital of Maharashtra [ edit ] 

Nagpur was the capital of Central Berar Province for 100 years and after the State Reorganisation, in 1956, Nagpur and Vidarbha region become part of the new Maharashtra State. With this Nagpur lost the capital status and hence a pact was signed between leaders called as the Nagpur Pact . According to the Nagpur Pact , Nagpur is the second capital of Maharashtra and the winter session of state legislature and the state legislative council takes place in Vidhan Bhavan, Nagpur . [58] :671 Nagpur has a District court and its own bench of the Bombay High Court . The city consists of six Vidhan Sabha constituencies namely Nagpur West , Nagpur South , Nagpur South West , Nagpur East , Nagpur North and Nagpur Central . These constituencies are part of the Nagpur Lok Sabha constituency . [59] Local Government [ edit ] 

The Municipal Council for Nagpur was established in 1864. At that time, the area under the jurisdiction of the Nagpur Municipal Council was 15.5 km 2 and the population was 82,000. The duties entrusted to the Nagpur Municipal Council were to maintain cleanliness and arrange for street lights and water supply with government assistance. The Municipal Corporation came into existence in March 1951. Nagpur is administered by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which is a democratically elected civic governing body. The Corporation elects a Mayor who along with a Deputy Mayor heads the organisation. The Mayor carries out the activities through various committees such as the Standing Committee, health and sanitation committee, education committee, water works, public works, public health and market committee. The administrative head of the Corporation is the Municipal Commissioner, an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. The Municipal Commissioner along with the Deputy Municipal Commissioners, carry out various activities related to engineering, health and sanitation, taxation and its recovery. Various departments such as public relations, library, health, finance, buildings, slums, roads, street lighting, traffic, establishment, gardens, public works, local audit, legal services, water works, education, octroi and fire services manage their specific activities. The activities of NMC are administered by its zonal offices. There are 10 zonal offices in Nagpur – Laxmi Nagar, Dharampeth, Hanuman Nagar, Dhantoli, Nehru Nagar, Gandhi Baugh, Sataranjipura, Lakkadganj, Ashi Nagar and Mangalwari. These zones are divided into 145 wards. Each ward is represented by a corporator, a majority of whom are elected in local elections . [60] NMC has various departments including healthcare, education, fire brigade etc. dedicated for each service and project of the city. [61] Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) is a local planning authority which works with NMC and carries out the development of the civic infrastructure and new urban areas on its behalf. NIT is headed by a Chairman, an Indian Administrative Service Officer appointed by the state government. [62] 

Nagpur Police is headed by a Police Commissioner who is of the rank of Additional Director General of Police of Maharashtra Police . Nagpur Police is Divided into 4 Zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police. [63] The State C.I.D Regional Headquarter [64] and State Reserve Police Force Campus [65] are situated in Nagpur. Utility Services [ edit ] 

Originally, all the utility services of the city were carried out by NMC departments, but from 2008 onwards privatisation had started for major utility services. [66] The Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW), a joint venture of Veolia Water India Pvt. Ltd and Vishwaraj Infrastructure Ltd., manages the water supply for the city as well as Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Water Treatment Plants at Gorewada, all the elevated service reservoirs, ground service reservoirs, master balancing reservoirs commonly known as Water Tanks. [67] This joint venture was established in November 2011 and was awarded the contract to execute 24x7 water supply project and operational and maintenance of water works for 25 years. [68] Kanak Resources Management Ltd. has been awarded the contract for garbage collection in the city as per Nagpur Bin Free Project in 2009 by NMC. [69] [70] It collects garbage from all the residents in the city and then delivers it to the Bhandewadi dumpyard in Nagpur's eastern part. [71] Similarly, in electricity supply, which was first managed by MSEB was then replaced by MSEDCL . After some years the distribution franchisee system was introduced to reduce the losses in the divisions and so Spanco was awarded the distribution franchisee for 15 years to manage three of the four divisions from Nagpur Urban circle namely, Civil Lines, Mahal and Gandhibagh on 23 February 2011 by MSEDCL . [72] [73] To facilitate this system, Spanco Nagpur Discom Limited or SNDL Nagpur company was formed for the sole purpose of electricity distribution and maintenance in three divisions of the city. [74] The power distribution and maintenance for the fourth division i.e. Congress Nagar division is still being managed by MSEDCL . [75] India Post which is a governmental postal department has two head post offices and many post offices and sub-post offices at various locations in the city and are part of the logistics services in the city along with various other private operators. [76] Health care [ edit ] See also: List of hospitals in Nagpur 

NMC in collaboration with Central Government , State Government , UNICEF , World Health Organization and Non-governmental organisation conducts and maintains various health schemes in the city. City health line is an initiative started by NMC dedicated to the health of citizens of Nagpur. This includes providing computerised comparative information and action in the field to Local citizens. [77] NMC runs three indoor patient hospitals including Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya at LAD square, Panchpaoli Maternity Hospital in Panchpaoli and Isolation Hospital in Immamwada. Besides, the civic body runs three big diagnostic centres at Mahal, Sadar and also at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya. Apart from these, NMC has 57 out patient dispensaries (OPDs), including 23 health posts sanctioned under Union Government's schemes, 15 allopathy hospitals, 12 ayurvedic hospitals, three homoeopathy hospitals, three naturopathy hospitals and one unani hospital. [78] In 2013, ABP News - Ipsos declared Nagpur the country's best city for health care services. [79] The city is home to numerous hospitals , some run by the government and some private.

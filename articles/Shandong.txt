Shandong ( Chinese : 山东 ; formerly romanized as Shantung ) is a coastal province of the People's Republic of China , and is part of the East China region. 

Shandong has played a major role in Chinese history from the beginning of Chinese civilization along the lower reaches of the Yellow River and served as a pivotal cultural and religious site for Taoism , Chinese Buddhism , and Confucianism . Shandong's Mount Tai is the most revered mountain of Taoism and one of the world's sites with the longest history of continuous religious worship. The Buddhist temples in the mountains to the south of the provincial capital of Jinan were once among the foremost Buddhist sites in China. The city of Qufu is the birthplace of Confucius , and was later established as the center of Confucianism. 

Shandong's location at the intersection of ancient as well as modern north–south and east–west trading routes have helped to establish it as an economic center. After a period of political instability and economic hardship that began in the late 19th century, Shandong has emerged as one of the most populous (95,793,065 inhabitants at the 2010 Census) and most affluent provinces in the People's Republic of China with a GDP of CNY ¥5.942 trillion in 2014, or USD $967 billion, making it China's third wealthiest province.

Name [ edit ] 

Individually, the two Chinese characters in the name "Shandong" mean "mountain" (山) and "east" (东). Shandong could hence be translated literally as "east of the mountains" and refers to the province's location to the east of the Taihang Mountains . [5] A common nickname for Shandong is Qílǔ (simplified Chinese: 齐 鲁 ; traditional Chinese: 齊 魯 ), after the States of Qi and Lu that existed in the area during the Spring and Autumn Period . Whereas the State of Qi was a major power of its era, the State of Lu played only a minor role in the politics of its time. Lu, however, became renowned for being the home of Confucius and hence its cultural influence came to eclipse that of the State of Qi. The cultural dominance of the State of Lu heritage is reflected in the official abbreviation for Shandong which is "鲁" (Chinese: 魯 ; pinyin: Lǔ ). [ citation needed ] English speakers in the 19th century called the province Shan-tung . [6] Location [ edit ] 

The province is located on the eastern edge of the North China Plain and in the lower reaches of the Yellow River (Huang He) and extends out to sea in the form of the Shandong Peninsula . Shandong borders the Bohai Sea to the north, Hebei to the northwest, Henan to the west, Jiangsu to the south, and the Yellow Sea to the southeast; it also shares a very short border with Anhui , between Henan and Jiangsu. History [ edit ] Ancient history [ edit ] A Song -era monument to a legendary native of Shandong, the Yellow Emperor , at his supposed birthplace Remains of Ancient Linzi city sewer passing underneath the former city wall 

With its location on the eastern edge of the North China Plain , Shandong was home to a succession of Neolithic cultures for millennia, including the Houli culture (6500–5500 BCE), the Beixin culture (5300–4100 BCE), the Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BCE), the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BCE), and the Yueshi culture (1900–1500 BCE). 

The earliest dynasties (the Shang dynasty and Zhou dynasty ) exerted varying degrees of control over western Shandong, while eastern Shandong was inhabited by the Dongyi peoples who were considered "barbarians". Over subsequent centuries, the Dongyi were eventually sinicized . 

During the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period , regional states became increasingly powerful. At this time, Shandong was home to two major states: the state of Qi at Linzi and the state of Lu at Qufu . Lu is noted for being the home of Confucius . The state was, however, comparatively small, and eventually succumbed to the larger state of Chu from the south. The state of Qi was, on the other hand, was a major power throughout the period. Cities it ruled included Linzi, Jimo (north of modern Qingdao ) and Ju . Early Imperial history [ edit ] 

The Qin dynasty conquered Qi and founded the first centralized Chinese state in 221 BCE. The Han dynasty that followed created a number of commanderies supervised by two regions (刺史部) in what is now modern Shandong: Qingzhou ( 青州 ) in the north and Yanzhou ( 兗州 ) in the south. During the division of the Three Kingdoms , Shandong belonged to the Cao Wei , which ruled over northern China. 

After the Three Kingdoms period, a brief period of unity under the Western Jin dynasty gave way to invasions by nomadic peoples from the north. Northern China, including Shandong, was overrun. Over the next century or so Shandong changed hands several times, falling to the Later Zhao , then Former Yan , then Former Qin , then Later Yan , then Southern Yan , then the Liu Song Dynasty , and finally the Northern Wei Dynasty , the first of the Northern Dynasties during the Northern and Southern Dynasties Period. Shandong stayed with the Northern Dynasties for the rest of this period. 

In 412 CE, the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian landed at Laoshan , on the southern edge of the Shandong peninsula, and proceeded to Qingzhou to edit and translate the scriptures he had brought back from India . 

The Sui dynasty reestablished unity in 589, and the Tang dynasty (618-907) presided over the next golden age of China. For the earlier part of this period Shandong was ruled as part of Henan Circuit , one of the circuits (a political division). Later on China splintered into warlord factions, resulting in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Shandong was part of the Five Dynasties, all based in the north. 

The Song dynasty reunified China in the late tenth century. In 1996, the discovery of over two hundred buried Buddhist statues at Qingzhou was hailed as a major archaeological find. The statues included early examples of painted figures, and are thought to have been buried due to Emperor Huizong 's repression of Buddhism (he favored Taoism ). 

The Song dynasty was forced to cede northern China to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1142. Shandong was administered by the Jin as Shandong East Circuit and Shandong West Circuit – the first use of its current name. Modern history [ edit ] Street market in the city, photographed by members of the Fragata Sarmiento 's crew in late XIX century. 

The modern province of Shandong was created by the Ming dynasty , where it had a more expansive territory including the agricultural part of Liaoning . After the Ming-Qing Transition in 1644, Shandong acquired (more or less) its current borders. 

During the nineteenth century, China became increasingly exposed to Western influence, and Shandong, a coastal province, was especially affected. Qingdao was leased to Germany in 1897 and Weihai to Britain in 1898. The rest of Shandong was generally considered to be part of the German sphere of influence . As a result of foreign pressure from the Russian Empire , which had annexed Outer Manchuria by 1860, the Qing dynasty encouraged settlement of Shandong people to what remained of northeast China . 

Shandong was one of the first places in which the Boxer Rebellion started and became one of the centers of the uprising. In 1899, the Qing general Yuan Shikai was appointed as governor of the province to suppress the uprising. He held the post for 3 years. 

As a consequence of the First World War , Germany lost Qingdao and its sphere of influence in Shandong. The Treaty of Versailles transferred the German concessions in Shandong to Japan instead of restoring Chinese sovereignty over the area. Popular dissatisfaction with this outcome, referred to as the Shandong Problem , led to the May Fourth Movement . Among the reservations to the Treaty that the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved was "to give Shantung to China," but Woodrow Wilson told his supporters in the Senate to vote against any substantive reservations. [7] Finally, Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the Washington Naval Conference . Weihai followed in 1930. 

The return of control over Shandong fell into the Warlord era of the Republic of China. Shandong was handed over to the Zhili clique of warlords, but after the Second Zhili-Fengtian War of 1924, the northeast China-based Fengtian clique took over. In April 1925, the Fengtian clique installed the warlord Zhang Zongchang , nicknamed the "Dogmeat General", as military governor of Shandong Province. Time dubbed him China's "basest warlord". [8] He ruled over the province until 1928, when he was ousted in the wake of the Northern Expedition . He was succeeded by Han Fuju , who was loyal to the warlord Feng Yuxiang but later switched his allegiance to the Nanjing government headed by Chiang Kai-Shek . Han Fuju also ousted the warlord Liu Zhennian , nicknamed the "King of Shandong East", who ruled eastern Shandong Province, hence unifying the province under his rule. Qingdao, The largest city of Shandong Province, 2016. 

In 1937 Japan began its invasion of China proper in the Second Sino-Japanese War , which would eventually become part of the Pacific theatre of the Second World War . Han Fuju was made Deputy Commander in Chief of the 5th War Area and put in charge defending the lower Yellow River valley. However, he abandoned his base in Jinan when the Japanese crossed the Yellow River. He was executed for not following orders shortly thereafter. 

Shandong was occupied in its entirety by Japan, with resistance continuing in the countryside, and was one of the provinces where a scorched earth policy (" Three Alls Policy ": "kill all", "burn all", "loot all") was implemented by general Yasuji Okamura . This lasted until the surrender of Japan in 1945. 

By 1945, communist forces already held some parts of Shandong. Over the next four years of the Chinese Civil War , they expanded their holdings, eventually driving the Kuomintang (government of the Republic of China ) out of Shandong by June 1949. The People's Republic of China was founded in October of the same year. 

Under the new government, parts of western Shandong were initially given to the short-lived Pingyuan Province , but this did not last. Shandong also acquired the Xuzhou and Lianyungang areas from Jiangsu province, but this did not last either. For the most part Shandong has kept the same borders that it has today. 

In recent years Shandong, especially eastern Shandong, has enjoyed significant economic development, becoming one of the richest provinces of the People's Republic of China. Geography [ edit ] The sacred Mount Tai . 

The northwestern, western, and southwestern parts of the province are all part of the vast North China Plain . The center of the province is more mountainous, with Mount Tai being the most prominent. The east of the province is the hilly Shandong Peninsula extending into the sea; it separates Bohai Sea in the northwest from the Yellow Sea to the east and south. The highest peak of Shandong is the highest peak in the Taishan area: Jade Emperor Peak , with a height of 1,545 metres (5,069 ft). [ citation needed ] 

The Yellow River passes through Shandong's western areas, entering the sea along Shandong's northern coast; in its traversal of Shandong it flows on a levee , higher than the surrounding land, and dividing western Shandong into the Hai He watershed in the north and the Huai River watershed in the south. The Grand Canal of China enters Shandong from the northwest and leaves on the southwest. Weishan Lake is the largest lake of the province. Shandong's coastline is 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) long. Shandong Peninsula has a rocky coastline with cliffs, bays, and islands; the large Laizhou Bay , the southernmost of the three bays of Bohai Sea , is found to the north, between Dongying and Penglai ; Jiaozhou Bay , which is much smaller, is found to the south, next to Qingdao . The Miaodao Islands extend northwards from the northern coast of the peninsula. 

Shandong has a temperate climate , lying in the transition between the humid subtropical ( Cwa under the Köppen climate classification ) and humid continental (Köppen Dwa ) zones with four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and rainy (except for a few coastal areas), while winters are cold and dry. Average temperatures are −5 to 1 °C (23 to 34 °F) in January and 24 to 28 °C (75 to 82 °F) in July. Annual precipitation is 550 to 950 mm (22 to 37 in), the vast majority of which occurs during summer, due to monsoonal influences. 

With Jinan serving as the province's economic and cultural centre, the province's economic prowess has led to the development of modern coastal cities located at Qingdao , Weihai , and Yantai . [ citation needed ] Geology [ edit ] 

Shandong is part of the Eastern Block of the North China craton . Beginning in the Mesozoic, Shandong has undergone a crustal thinning that is unusual for a craton and that has reduced the thickness of the crust from 200 km (120 mi) to as little as 80 km (50 mi). Shandong has hence experienced extensive volcanism in the Tertiary. 

Some geological formations in Shandong are rich in fossils. For example, Zhucheng , which is located in southeastern Shandong, has been the site of many discoveries of dinosaur fossils. A major find of 7,600 dinosaur bones that including tyrannosaurus and ankylosaurus remains was announced in 2008, and is believed to be the largest collection ever found.

The politics of Shandong is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. 

The Governor of Shandong is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Shandong. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Shandong Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Shandong CPC Party Chief ". This province is third richest in China and maintained close relationship with Japan and South Korea . Economy [ edit ] 

As of 1832, Shandong was exporting fruits, vegetables, wine, drugs, and deer skin, often heading to Guangzhou in exchange for clothing and fabrics. [6] 

Shandong ranks first among the provinces in the production of a variety of products, including cotton and wheat as well as precious metals such as gold and diamonds . It also has one of the biggest sapphire deposits in the world. [10] Other important crops include sorghum and maize . Shandong has extensive petroleum deposits as well, especially in the Dongying area in the Yellow River delta, where the Shengli Oil Field (lit. Victory Oilfield) is one of the major oilfields of China. Shandong also produces bromine from underground wells and salt from sea water. It is the largest agricultural exporter in China. 

Shandong is one of the richer provinces of China, and its economic development focuses on large enterprises with well-known brand names. Shandong is the biggest industrial producer and one of the top manufacturing provinces in China. Shandong has also benefited from South Korean and Japanese investment and tourism, due to its geographical proximity to those countries. [11] The richest part of the province is the Shandong Peninsula , where the city of Qingdao is home to three of the most well-known brand names of China: Tsingtao Beer , Haier and Hisense . In addition, Dongying 's oil fields and petroleum industries form an important component of Shandong's economy. Despite the primacy of Shandong's energy sector, the province has also been plagued with problems of inefficiency and ranks as the largest consumer of fossil fuels in all of China. [11] 

In 2011, the nominal GDP for Shandong was ¥ 4.50 trillion (US$711 billion), ranking third in the country (behind Guangdong and Jiangsu ). Its GDP per capita was ¥42,014 (US$6,365), ranking eighth. Wine industry [ edit ] See also: Wine in China Shandong Coastal Vineyards 

The production of wine is the second largest [ citation needed ] industry in the Shandong Province, second only to agriculture. 

Geographically, the southern hills average an elevation of 200 meters (660 ft), while the coastal areas remain relatively flat. Most of the soil is loose, well-ventilated, and rich in minerals and organic matter that enable full development of the root systems. 

Presently, there are more than 140 wineries in the region, mainly distributed in the Nanwang Grape Valley and along the Yan-Peng Sightseeing Highway. The region produced more than 40% of China's grape wine production. [12] Main varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon , Cabernet Gernischt , Merlot , Riesling and Chardonnay are all at 20 years of age, considered to be the golden stage for these grapes. Most of them maintain an average saccharinity of above 20%.

The seventeen prefecture-level divisions of Shandong are subdivided into 137 county-level divisions (51 districts , 28 county-level cities , and 58 counties ). Those are in turn divided into 1941 township-level divisions (1223 towns , 293 townships , two ethnic townships , and 423 subdistricts ). Culture [ edit ] 

Mandarin dialects are spoken in Shandong. Linguists classify these dialects into three broad categories: Ji Lu Mandarin spoken in the northwest (as well as in neighbouring Hebei ), such as the Jinan dialect ; Zhongyuan Mandarin spoken in the southwest (as well as in neighbouring Henan ); and Jiao Liao Mandarin spoken in the Shandong Peninsula (as well as the Liaodong Peninsula across the sea), such as the Qingdao dialect . When people speak of the "Shandong dialect" (山東話), it is generally the first or the second that is meant; the Jiao Liao dialects of Shandong are commonly called the "Jiaodong dialect" (膠東話). 

Shandong cuisine (鲁菜) is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine . It can be more finely divided into inland Shandong cuisine (e.g. Jinan cuisine ); the seafood -centered Jiaodong cuisine in the peninsula; and Confucius's Mansion cuisine , an elaborate tradition originally intended for imperial and other important feasts. 

Shandong Bangzi and Lüju are popular types of Chinese opera in Shandong; both originated from southwestern Shandong. Transport [ edit ]

Recife ( Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁeˈsifi] ( listen ) ) is the sixth-largest [1] metropolitan area in Brazil with 3,743,854 inhabitants, the largest metropolitan area of the North/Northeast Regions, the sixth largest metropolitan influence area in Brazil, and the capital and largest city of the state of Pernambuco . The population of the city proper was 1,555,039 in 2012. [2] 

The former capital of the 17th century Dutch Brazil , Recife was founded in 1537, during the early Portuguese colonization of Brazil, as the main harbor of the Captaincy of Pernambuco , known for its large scale production of sugar cane . The city is located at the confluence of the Beberibe and Capibaribe rivers before they flow into the Atlantic Ocean. It is a major port on the Atlantic Ocean. Its name is an allusion to the stone reefs that are present by the city's shores. The many rivers, small islands and over 50 bridges found in Recife city centre characterise its geography and led to the city being called the "Brazilian Venice ". As of 2010 [update] , it is the capital city with the highest HDI in Northeast Brazil . [3] 

The Metropolitan Region of Recife is the main industrial zone of the State of Pernambuco ; major products are those derived from cane (sugar and ethanol ), ships, oil platforms, electronics, and others. With fiscal incentives by the government, many industrial companies were started in the 1970s and 1980s. Recife has a tradition of being the most important commercial hub of the North/Northeastern region of Brazil, with more than 52,500 business enterprises in Recife plus 32,500 in the Metro Area, totaling more than 85,000. [4] 

A combination of a large supply of labor and significant private investments turned Recife into Brazil's second largest medical hub (second only to São Paulo ); [5] modern hospitals with state-of-the-art equipment receive patients from several neighbouring States. [6] [7] 

Recife stands out as a major tourist attraction of the Northeast , both for its beaches and for its historic sites, dating back to both the Portuguese and the Dutch colonization of the region. The beach of Porto de Galinhas , 60 kilometers (37 mi) south of the city, has been repeatedly awarded the title of best beach in Brazil and has drawn many tourists. The Historic Centre of Olinda , 7 kilometers (4.3 mi) north of the city, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982, and both cities' Brazilian Carnival are among the world's most famous. 

The city is an education hub, and home to the Federal University of Pernambuco , the largest university in Pernambuco. Several Brazilian historical figures, such as the poet and abolitionist Castro Alves , moved to Recife for their studies. Recife and Natal are the only Brazilian cities with direct flights to the islands of Fernando de Noronha , a World Heritage Site. [8] 

The city was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Additionally, Recife hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1950 FIFA World Cup .

Olinda with Recife in the background. Olinda was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. 

Recife began as a collection of fishing shacks, inns and warehouses on the delta between the Capibaribe and Beberibe Rivers in the captaincy of Pernambuco , sometime between 1535 and 1537 in the earliest days of Portuguese colonisation of Terra de Santa Cruz , later called Brazil , on the northeast coast of South America . It was a settlement of colonial fishermen and way station for Portuguese sailors. The first documented reference to the settlement with its " arrecife dos navios " (reef of the ships) was in the royal Charter Act of March 12, 1537, establishing Olinda , 6 km to the north, as a village , with its port where the Beberibe River meets the sea. Olinda (and Igarassu before it) had been settled in 1536 by captain General Duarte Coelho , a Portuguese nobleman, proprietor and administrator of the captaincy of Pernambuco. [9] 

The city is named for the long reef recife running parallel to the shoreline which encloses its harbour. The reef is not as sometimes stated, a coral reef, but a consolidated ancient beach, now as firm and hard as stone. [10] 

In 1541, Coelho returned from Portugal with the machinery for an engenho (sugarmill), and with it, his brother-in-law established the first mill named Nossa Senhora da Ajuda (Our Lady of Help), in the floodplain of the Beberibe River at Recife. At that time the banks of the Capibaribe River were covered by sugarcane. 

Recife was capital of the 17th century Dutch Brazil and was called Mauritsstad . 

The Mascate War of 1710-1711 pitted merchants of Recife against those of nearby Olinda . Geography [ edit ] Open skies in Recife. The city has one of the greatest rainfall averages in Brazil. The Pina Basin Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. 

Due to the city's proximity to the equator , Recife weather is generally warm. Recife has a number of islands, rivers, waterways and bridges that crisscross the city. Recife is located amidst tropical forests which are distinguished by high rainfall levels resulting in poor soil quality as the rainfall washes away the nutrients. There is an absence of extreme temperatures and a cool breeze due to the trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean. [11] Climate [ edit ] 

Recife has a tropical climate ( As in Köppen climate classification ), with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by pleasant trade winds blowing in from the ocean. [12] Under the Köppen climate classification , the city features a tropical monsoon climate . January and February are the warmest months, with mean temperatures ranging from 30 °C (86 °F) to 22 °C (72 °F), with sun; July is the cloudiest month, experiences the coolest temperatures, with mean temperatures ranging from 27 °C (81 °F) to 21 °C (70 °F), and is the wettest month, receiving an average of 388 mm (15.3 in) of rain. [13] [14] [15] [16] The driest and sunniest month is November, when maximum temperatures hover around 30 °C (86 °F) and an average of 36 mm (1.4 in) of rain is recorded.

Recife has a tropical forest. Rainforests are characterised by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 2,000 millimetres (79 in) and 1,700 millimetres (67 in). The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients. There are several common characteristics of tropical rainforest trees. The city of Recife is formed by three islands (Recife, Santo Antônio, and Boa Vista). [22] Between the islands are the rivers Beberibe and Capibaribe. [23] Hydrography [ edit ]

Recife is one of Brazil 's prime business centres, largely because it has one International Airport and two International ports . One is located in the town itself, and the other, the port of Suape, is located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) away. Just south of Recife is the region 's main industrial area , where the following industries can be found: brewing and canning, shipbuilding, automotive, electronics, tube manufacturing, chocolate manufacturing, textiles, etc. [31] 

Recife has shared in the prosperity of Northeastern Brazil that resulted from development promoted after 1960 by Sudene (Superintendência para o Desenvolvimento do Nordeste), a federal organisation . Although its retail and wholesale trade have grown in response to the region's increases in population and wealth, the market area and the walkways of the city's bridges are crowded with vendors selling small items.

Software manufacturing is the main activity in the Porto Digital. [34] The Porto Digital cluster comprises small and medium companies, but multinationals like Accenture , Motorola , Samsung , Dell and Sun Microsystems are also installed in Porto Digital. IBM and Microsoft transferred their regional headquarters to Recife. [35] 

Porto Digital's startups can count on a ready pool of talent, courtesy of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), which boasts one of the best computer-science departments in all of Latin America. [36] The school began teaching programmers to use Sun Microsystems Inc.'s (SUNW) Java language in 1996, the year it was introduced. Professors at the school also teamed up to launch Centro de Estudos e Sistemas Avançados do Recife (C.E.S.A.R), a business incubator that has played a vital role in the birth of some 30 companies .

Culture [ edit ] 

Recife is the home of several artists, musicians and writers. It is also home to the frevo , a regional dance and music, typical in carnival, and Mangue Beat , a type of Brazilian rock with mixture of Maracatu , Ciranda, Rap and other musical styles. The Festival de São João, held annually in June, celebrates traditional culture and music that originated in the region. Abril Pro Rock, held every April, showcases contemporary rock music. 

During carnival, downtown Recife holds one of the most authentic and democratic celebrations: every year more than one and a half million people open the festivities of the Brazilian Carnival at Galo da Madrugada. Recife and Olinda combined [50] have 25 museums, 38 art galleries, 2 Orchestra houses, 15 theatres, 1 opera house and more than 40 movie theatres. Carnival [ edit ] Main article: Brazilian Carnival Galo da Madrugada , Recife Carnival. Olinda Carnival, in the historic city of Olinda , near Recife. 

The four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is carnival time in Brazil . Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they party in the streets. Pernambuco has large Carnival celebrations with more than 3000 shows in the street historic centre performed for over than 430 local groups, including the Frevo , typical Pernambuco music. Another famous carnival music style from Pernambuco is Maracatu. The cities of Recife and Olinda hold the most authentic and democratic carnaval celebrations in Brazil . The largest carnival in Brazil is Galo da Madrugada, which takes place in Downtown Recife on Carnival Saturday. Another famous event is the "Noite dos Tambores Silenciosos." Carnival Recife's joyous Carnival is nationally known, attracting thousands of people every year. 

The party starts a week before the official date, with electric trios "shaking" the Boa Viagem Neighborhood. On Friday, people take to the streets to dance to the sound of frevo and to dance with maracatu, ciranda, caboclinhos, afoxé, reggae and manguebeat groups. There are still many other entertainment poles spread out around the city, featuring local and national artists. One of the highlights is Saturday when more than one and a half million people follow the Galo da Madrugada group. [51] Everyday, there is the Night of the Silent Drums, on the Pátio do Terço, where Maracatus honor slaves that died in prisons . [52] 

" Frevo " was born from the confluence of European and Afro-Brazilian cultures , [53] as probably did all the other musical genres consolidated in Brazil. Historians from Pernambuco say that, before the term appeared in Recife's 'Jornal Pequeno', it was already heard and danced in a symbiosis of polkas, 'modinhas', 'dobrados' e 'maxixes' e 'jogos pastoris' (stick and rope formations) along the streets of Pernambuco 's capital. [54] 

The music bands (civilian or military) of the time helped giving the sound the defining character we have come to know as the Frevo , a musical mass defined by the brasses. About the Street- Frevo , conductor Guerra Peixe said once that "it is the only popular genre that does not admit the 'play-by-ear composer'. He was referring to the technical hardship of this kind of music, and stressing the role of conductors who led the 'frevistical' troupes. Museums [ edit ] Main article: Pernambuco Museums Caixa Cultural Recife. 

The Museum of Pernambuco State was housed in a 19th-century mansion in Recife, the "Museu do Estado de Pernambuco (MEPE)" dates back to 1929. From Masters who portrayed the Colonial period, as well as the Dutch invasion (1630) to 20th and 21st century, the museum comprises over 12 thousand art pieces. 

Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue 

Sinagoga Kahal Zur Israel, the historic Recife synagogue in Recife Antigo, is the oldest in the Americas, dating to 1646. The original synagogue was destroyed, but a new one was built on site. In the 21st century, it was restored for use as a museum. It is an important part of Pernambuco's historic patrimony. It was founded by Jews who settled in the Netherlands after expulsion from Spain and Portugal. They emigrated with the Dutch to " New Holland " when the Dutch invaded the northeastern portion of Brazilian lands occupied by the Portuguese. When the Portuguese reconquered the land, these Sephardic Jews moved further north with the Dutch , and helped found " New Amsterdam " (now New York City) on Manhattan Island. [55] The first New York City synagogue was created in Lower Manhattan by the founders of the first synagogue in the New World in Recife. It later moved to the Upper West Side, where it is still called " The Portuguese and Spanish Synagogue ".

Ricardo Brennand Institute . The best museum in South America . [56] Cinema [ edit ] Main article: Recife Cinema Festival 

Also known as Recife Audiovisual Festival or Cine-PE , Recife Cinema Festival is a competitive film and audiovisual festival that is held in Recife. It is dedicated to the Brazilian and state production of feature short films ; as well as videos and documentaries . It was founded in 1997 by the Alfredo Sandra Bertini, who have been the directors since then. Between 1997 and 2008, 1806 films [57] (through either competitive applications or National International invitations) of all types and genres for a public of over 250,000 people have been a part of it. 

Recife and consequently Pernambuco has a tradition in the Brazilian film making history. In the pioneer times of the Brazilian cinema emerged the Regional movements . One of those, was designated Ciclo de Recife [58] ( Recife cycle ), between 1922-1931. Despite adverse conditions, during this cycle was realised in Recife 13 feature films (usually about drama Romance) and 7 realistic films (usually ordered by authorities to show their public works). Despite pervasive influence of U.S. and European cinemas in the silent film times, the Recife cycle was one of the most important, regional and productive of them. One of the most important movie was Aitaré da Praia , which is recognised for pioneering the rise of regional themes (1925). Another large successful films was Retribuição (1923) and A Filha do Advogado (1926). Another important phase of the Pernambuco/Recife film history was in the 1970s with a movement called Super 8 , often used for home videos and documentaries realised by students, curious and aspirant film makers, due to the utilisation of 8 mm film, proportionated by the new technology released by Kodak .

Port of Recife is located in the city of Recife. Road access to Port of Recife is accomplished, mainly, through the federal highways BR-232 (linking the interior of the state) and BR-101 (linking to other States to the north and the south of the State of Pernambuco). The main producing and consuming centres of the interior of the state and of the rest of the Northeast , are linked to Port by paved highways.

Football in Pernambuco began in 1902, when English and Dutch sailors landed in Recife and played a game of football on the beach. The new game aroused the interest of the people of Pernambuco, and they soon started playing. 

Recife provides visitors and residents with various sporting activities. There are several football clubs based in Recife, such as Sport the current 2014 State Champion (40 times state champion and once national champion (1987) and Brazil's Cup champion (2008)), Santa Cruz (26 times state champion) and Náutico (21 times state champion and unique 6 consecutives). The Campeonato Pernambucano (Pernambuco's State Championship) is divided into Taça Revolução and Taça Confederação. They both have the same format: standard round-robin, in which all teams play each other once. A round-robin tournament or all-play-all tournament is a type of group tournament in which each participant plays every other participant an equal number of times. If a team wins both Taça Tabocas e Guararapes and Taça Confederação do Equador, it is crowned the state champion . If not, a home-and-away playoff with the winners is disputed, and the winner is declared the state champion. 

Also, the city has traditions in another sports as: Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Tenis, Table tenis, Volleyball, beach volley, Handball, Surf, Skateboard, Bodysurf, Swimning pool and Futsal. Provided by clubs such as: Nautico, Sport, Santa Cruz, Portuguese Club of Recife, Caxanga Golf Country Club, Mauricio de Nassau University, School of Tenis Recife as others. 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cup [ edit ] Arena Pernambuco , the stadium of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Recife was one of the 12 cities to host games for the 2014 FIFA World Cup , for which Brazil was the host nation. The Metropolitan Recife project consists of a new Sports City to be built in São Lourenço da Mata in an intersection area near to Recife, Jaboatão dos Guararapes and Camaragibe . The new Sports complex is 19 km (12 mi) west of Recife city centre and 19 km (12 mi) from the Airport. 

The sports complex 'City' [73] will have a new stadium ( Arena Cidade da Copa ) with 45,000 seats, 9,000 flats, 6,000 car parking spaces, 1 hospital, 1 technical school, 1 shopping centre, 1 integrated metro/bus station and improvement of federal roads, all with an estimated cost of R$1.6 billion. Further expenses will be necessary in the metro area for remodelling of roads and airport expansion. 

This was the second time Recife has been chosen to be one of the host cities of the FIFA World Cup . In 1950 , Recife hosted just one game in the Brazil World Cup between Chile and the United States, at Ilha do Retiro Stadium. At this time, it was the only city which represented the Northeast of Brazil . Social and environmental issues [ edit ] Main articles: Crime in Brazil , Social issues in Brazil , and Social apartheid in Brazil 

Violence General Headquarters Command of Pernambuco Military Police. Pernambuco Court of Justice. 

In 2013, Recife had the 38th highest homicide rate in The Americas , after Detroit , New Orleans , Baltimore , San Juan and other cities. [74] 

PESP plan 

The State Governor Eduardo Campos introduced the PESP plan (Security state Plan - Plano Estadual de Seguranca Publica) on second of May 2009, which will try [75] to reduce homicides by 12% each year until they reach half of the previous rate. The plan is based on the fact that 60% of the murders are committed by people related to criminal activities and reaches from the prevention stage until the correctional stage. 

Carnival security plan 

ISS servers managed 50 Pelco Spectra PTZ cameras to capture all activity within the city's celebratory areas. Continued deployment of this project at Recife will continue towards a short-term goal of over 1000 cameras blanketing the city. Immediate statistics during the Carnival period indicate a reduction in violent crime of over 30%. [76] [77] Recuperation program [ edit ] 

UNICEF is an international development agency, which supports locally initiated projects with an emphasis on children. Recife offered an environment to utilise its rich cultural heritage to develop programs aimed at its most serious issues. One of the most hands-on projects was a radio program named "Jovens Comunicadores" (Communicating Youth). [78] It trained a group of eighteen adolescents to produce a weekly radio program focusing on child labour . The program is recorded and sent to community radio stations, most of which are broadcast in the sugar cane area where many children work. Jovens Comunicadores advocates and lobbies against exploitation, all produced and edited by teens. As a radio program, it also plays regional music, giving a boost to local culture . [79] 

"Criança Feliz" (Happy Child) had the same objective, eliminating child exploitation, but used a different approach. It was begun by a women's organisation and offered after-school activities with the goal of discouraging children and adolescents from working in sex tourism. Besides giving classes and training in computers, English, art, and karate, it also offered psychological services and group therapy . These combined services sought to equip children not only with skills but also a positive self-image and respect to not fall into prostitution . As all the kids came from very poor backgrounds, the financial pull of prostitution is very high. Criança Feliz worked at educating them about the high costs in the long term. This was a very interesting project, since it was actually a house with groups of kids divided into participating in different activities. [80] Shark attacks [ edit ] Signs warning of shark attacks at Boa Viagem Beach. Natural pools - Boa Viagem Beach. 

Shark attacks were addressed in the National Geographic Channel series Hunter Hunted in the episode "Shark Invasion." Surfing has been outlawed since 1995 on the urban beaches (Pina, Boa Viagem , Piedade, and Candeias) because of the risk the sport poses to its practitioners due to shark attacks . It is strongly recommended that bathers not climb over and swim beyond the reefs because of strong, unpredictable currents and the possible presence of bull sharks. Several beaches have messages alerting people to the danger of meeting sharks , although this is very rare, as in most parts of Brazil . [81] 

Before the 1990s there were virtually no attacks reported here, but since 1992 there have been 59 shark attacks along a 20 km (12 mi) stretch of coast; 24 of them were fatal. [82] 

Scientists believe most of these attacks are committed by two species, bull sharks and tiger sharks , but forensic evidence has only been able to confirm the species responsible in eight of these attacks. Bull sharks are considered to be one of the most dangerous shark species, with many proven attacks against humans. There are almost two million people in Recife and surrounding areas, and there are many beaches conveniently located in and around the city, but some 700 meters off the coast lies a deep trench running parallel to the beaches near the city. Sharks use this trench as a migratory route and emerge from it to hunt in the shallows. 

It is Recife's Port Suape, though, that many see as the biggest cause of the recent attacks. Located 20 kilometres (12 miles ) south of Boa Viagem Beach, where most of the attacks have occurred, the port has been the cause of much disturbance for marine life along the coast and the nearby estuaries. To facilitate its initial construction, in the late 1970s, two freshwater estuaries which had discharged into the Atlantic Ocean were sealed off. The port opened for business in 1984, (and today handles more than four million tonnes of cargo per year) but it was not until 1992 that it began to attract significant shipping traffic. Before 1992, Recife had no more shark attacks than any other beach in Brazil, but the change was immediate and dramatic. 

To build the port, estuaries were dredged and long docks built, protruding out into the ocean. This is especially a problem for bull sharks, who generally stay close to land and are able to tolerate fresh water (they are regularly encountered in rivers such as the Amazon ). Much of their life cycle is dependent on coastal estuaries and the building of Suape is thought to have disrupted breeding and hunting habits. 

Cemit, the Council for Shark Hazard Monitoring, conducts a catch-and-release program to remove the sharks from beaches. 81 sharks were caught [ when? ] , tagged with tracking devices, and released far out to sea. Its GPS data on the sharks tagged show that after being caught, all tiger sharks have migrated to other regions. To get the sharks further out to sea, Cemit in 2006 sank three boats on the far side of the ocean trench to create an artificial reef. This was to attract fish to congregate around the boats so that sharks coming out of the trench to hunt would move away from the beach. [83] 

The state-funded investigation has focused on the long-term ecological effects of the new port of Suape. Based on its findings, local human rights lawyers are considering a symbolic legal challenge to the State of Pernambuco , with the aim of securing compensation for the victims of attacks.

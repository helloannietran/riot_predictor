Camden is a city in Camden County , New Jersey , United States. The county seat , [22] [23] it is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia Pennsylvania . At the 2010 United States Census , the city had a population of 77,344, [10] [12] [13] representing a decline of 2,560 (3.2%) from the 79,904 residents enumerated during the 2000 Census , which had in turn declined by 7,588 (8.7%) from the 87,492 counted in the 1990 Census . [24] Camden ranked as the 12th-most populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 10th in 2000. [11] 

Camden was incorporated as a city on February 13, 1828, from portions of the now-defunct Newton Township , while the area was still part of Gloucester County . On March 13, 1844, Camden became part of the newly formed Camden County. [25] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden . [26] [27] 

Three of Camden's mayors have been jailed for corruption, the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000. [28] From 2005 to 2012, the school system and police department were operated by the state of New Jersey. [29] [30] [31] [32] 40% of residents are below the national poverty line . [33] 

Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States in 2012, with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people, [34] 6.6 times higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens. [35]

History [ edit ] Early history [ edit ] 

Fort Nassau (within the present boundaries of nearby Gloucester City, New Jersey ), was built by the Dutch West India Company in 1626, and was the first European attempt to settle the area now occupied by Camden. Initial European activity in the vicinity of present-day Camden occurred along the banks of the Delaware River where the Dutch and the Swedish vied for control of the local fur trade. Europeans continued to settle in and improve the area throughout the 17th century. Much of the growth directly resulted from the success of another Quaker colony across the Delaware River known as Philadelphia , which was founded in 1682 and soon had enough population to attract a brisk trade from West Jersey and Camden. To accommodate the trade across the river, a string of ferries began operation. [36] 19th century [ edit ] 

For over 150 years, Camden served as a secondary economic and transportation hub for the Philadelphia area. But that status began to change in the early 19th century. One of the U.S.'s first railroads, the Camden and Amboy Railroad , was chartered in Camden in 1830. The Camden and Amboy Railroad allowed travelers to travel between New York City and Philadelphia via ferry terminals in South Amboy, New Jersey and Camden. The railroad terminated on the Camden waterfront , and passengers were ferried across the Delaware River to their final Philadelphia destination. The Camden and Amboy Railroad opened in 1834 and helped to spur an increase in population and commerce in Camden. [37] Walt Whitman House , Camden, New Jersey 

Horse ferries, or team boats served Camden in the early 1800s. They stopped for an hour at lunch time to feed the horses. [38] The Ridgeway was a double team boat, propelled by nine horses walking around a circle. She ran from the foot of Cooper Street. There was also a team boat named the Washington ; she ran from Market Street, Camden, to Market Street, Philadelphia . Other team boats followed in succession, namely the Phoenix , Constitution , Moses Lancaster , and Independence . [39] The Cooper's Ferry Daybook, 1819–1824 , documenting Camden's Point Pleasant Teamboat , survives to this day. [40] 

Originally a suburban town with ferry service to Philadelphia, Camden evolved into its own city, as industry and neighborhoods grew. Like other industrial towns, Camden prospered during strong periods of manufacturing demand and faced distress during periods of economic dislocation. [41] Remarks from FDR 1944 Camden visit 

Like most American cities, Camden suffered from decline in the 20th century as the manufacturing base and many residents moved out to other locations. Currently, government, education, and health care are the three biggest employers in Camden; however, most employees commute to Camden and live in nearby suburbs such as Cherry Hill . Revitalization has occurred along the Camden Waterfront and in the neighborhoods of Cooper Grant, Cramer Hill, and Fairview, with direct access to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Industrial history [ edit ] 

From 1901 through 1929, Camden was headquarters of the Victor Talking Machine Company , and thereafter to its successor RCA Victor , the world's largest manufacturer of phonographs and phonograph records for the first two-thirds of the 20th century. [42] Victor contained some of the first commercial recording studios in the United States, where Enrico Caruso , among others, recorded. General Electric reacquired RCA and the Camden factory in 1986. [43] 

In 1992, the state of New Jersey under the Florio administration made an agreement with GE to ensure that GE would not close the Camden site. The state of New Jersey would build a new high-tech facility on the site of the old Campbell Soup Company factory and trade these new buildings to GE for the existing old RCA Victor buildings. Later, the new high tech buildings would be sold to Martin Marietta . In 1994, Martin Marietta merged with Lockheed to become Lockheed Martin . In 1997, Lockheed Martin divested the Camden Plant as part of the birth of L-3 Communications . [44] The Nipper Building 

The " Nipper Building " depicting RCA Victor's famous "His Master's Voice" trademark in its tower windows has since been renovated into a luxury apartment building called "The Victor". Building 8 is set to be rehabilitated into luxury condominiums called "Radio Lofts". Both projects are the work of Dranoff Properties, a Philadelphia development corporation that has specialized in these types of constructions. [45] Another older building, Victor Building No. 2, is used to this day to house the Camden City Board of Education. Most of the other RCA Victor buildings have long since been demolished. 

From 1899 to 1967, Camden was the home of New York Shipbuilding Corporation , which at its World War II peak was the largest and most productive shipyard in the world. [46] Notable naval vessels built at New York Ship include the ill-fated cruiser USS Indianapolis and the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk . In 1962, the first commercial nuclear-powered ship, the NS Savannah , was launched in Camden. [47] The Fairview Village section of Camden (initially Yorkship Village ) is a planned European-style garden village that was built by the Federal government during World War I to house New York Shipbuilding Corporation workers. [48] 

At Camden's peak, 12,000 workers were employed at RCA, [49] while another 30,000 worked at New York Shipbuilding. [50] RCA had 23 out of 25 of its factories inside Camden. Campbell Soup was also a major employer. [51] By 1969, Camden had been losing jobs and residents for a quarter century due in large part to urban decay, highway construction, and racial tensions. [52] 

In his book Capital Moves: RCA's Seventy-Year Quest for Cheap Labor , Jefferson Cowie mentions that Camden in the 1920s was known as "the Citadel of Republicanism". [53] 

On June 6, 1933, the city hosted the first drive-in movie . [54] [55] Second half of the 20th century [ edit ] 

After years of economic and industrial growth, the city of Camden faced years of rising crime and blight. On September 6, 1949, mass murderer Howard Unruh went on a killing spree in his Camden neighborhood killing thirteen people. Unruh, who was convicted and subsequently confined to a state psychiatric facility, died on October 19, 2009. [56] 

Rutgers University absorbed the former College of South Jersey to create Rutgers University–Camden in 1950. [57] 

Sections of downtown were looted and torched after racial riots occurred following the beating and death of a Puerto Rican motorist by city police in August 1971. [58] 

The Camden 28 were a group of anti-Vietnam War activists who, in 1971, planned and executed a raid on the Camden draft board, resulting in a high-profile trial against the activists that was seen by many as a referendum on the Vietnam War in which 17 of the defendants were acquitted by a jury even though they admitted having participated in the break-in. [59] The station for the RiverLINE (which opened in 2004) at the Walter Rand Transportation Center in central Camden is located where the RiverLINE intersects with the PATCO High Speed Line and 19 New Jersey Transit bus lines. Cooper University Hospital is visible in the background. 

In 1996, Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman frisked Sherron Rolax , a 16-year-old African-American youth, an event which was captured in an infamous photograph. Rolax alleged his civil rights were violated and sued the state of New Jersey. [60] 

In 1999, Camden was selected as the location for the USS New Jersey (BB-62) . [61] That ship remains in Camden. 

In response to the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, various strip clubs, hotels, and other businesses along Admiral Wilson Boulevard were torn down in 1999, and a park that once existed along the road was replenished. [62] 

In 2004, conversion of the RCA Nipper Building to The Victor, an upscale apartment building was completed. [63] The same year, the River LINE , between the Entertainment Center at the Waterfront in Camden and the Transit Center in Trenton , was opened, with a stop directly across from the RCA Nipper Building. 

The same year, Cooper University Hospital began a large scale expansion in an attempt to create a regional health center in Camden. The main building is a block away from the Walter Rand Transportation Center . 

In 2010, massive police corruption was exposed that resulted in the convictions of several policemen, dismissals of 185 criminal cases, and lawsuit settlements totaling $3.5 million that were paid to 88 victims. [64] [65] [66] The Chief of the Camden County Police Department is John Scott Thomson. [67] [68] Geography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city had a total area of 10.341 square miles (26.784 km 2 ), including 8.921 square miles (23.106 km 2 ) of land and 1.420 square miles (3.677 km 2 ) of water (13.73%). [2] [3] 

Camden borders Collingswood , Gloucester City , Haddon Township , Pennsauken Township and Woodlynne in Camden County, as well as Philadelphia across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania . [69] Just offshore of Camden is Pettys Island , which is part of Pennsauken Township. 

Camden contains the United States' first federally funded planned community for working class residents, Yorkship Village (now called Fairview). [70] The village was designed by Electus Darwin Litchfield , who was influenced by the "garden city" developments popular in England at the time. [71] Neighborhoods [ edit ] 

Camden has more than 20 generally recognized neighborhoods: [72] [73] [74] [75] Ablett Village Bergen Square Beideman Broadway Centerville Center City/Downtown Camden/Central Business District Central Waterfront Cooper Cooper Grant Cooper Point Cramer Hill Dudley East Camden Fairview Gateway Kaighn Point Lanning Square Liberty Park Marlton Morgan Village North Camden Parkside Pavonia Pyne Point Rosedale South Camden Stockton Waterfront South Whitman Park Yorkship Port [ edit ] 

On the Delaware River, with access to the Atlantic Ocean , the Port of Camden handles break bulk and bulk cargo . The port consists of two terminals: the Beckett Street Terminal and the Broadway Terminal. The port receives hundreds of ships moving international and domestic cargo annually. [76] 

In 2005, the Port of Camden (South Jersey Port Corporation) was subject to an unresolved criminal investigation [77] and a state audit. [78] Some activities in the port are under the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Port Authority . Climate [ edit ]

Officially organized in 1869, the Camden Fire Department (CFD) is the oldest paid fire department in New Jersey and is among the oldest paid fire departments in the United States. In 1916, the CFD was the first in the United States that had an all-motorized fire apparatus fleet. [173] [174] Layoffs have forced the city to rely on assistance from volunteer fire companies in surrounding communities when firefighters from all 10 fire companies are unavailable due to calls. [175] 

The Camden Fire Department currently operates out of six fire stations, located throughout the city in 2 Battalions, commanded by 2 Battalion Chiefs per shift, in addition to an on-duty Deputy Chief. The CFD fire apparatus fleet consists of 5 Engine Companies, 3 Ladder Companies, 1 Squad Company, 1 Rescue Company, and several other special, support, and reserve units. Since 2010, the Camden Fire Department has suffered severe economic cutbacks, including company closures and staffing cuts. [176] Fire station locations and apparatus [ edit ]

[177] The waterfront is also the headquarters for Catapult Learning , a provider of K−12 contracted instructional services to public and private schools in the United States, and WebiMax , a full-service internet marketing company. 

The Adventure Aquarium was originally opened in 1992 as the New Jersey State Aquarium at Camden. In 2005, after extensive renovation, the aquarium was reopened under the name Adventure Aquarium. [178] The aquarium was one of the original centerpieces in Camden's plans to revitalize the city. [179] 

The Susquehanna Bank Center (formerly known as the Tweeter Center) is a 25,000-seat open-air concert amphitheater opened in 1995 and renamed after a 2008 deal in which the bank would pay $10 million over 15 years for naming rights. [180] 

Campbell's Field, opened in 2001, was home to the Camden Riversharks (which folded in 2015) [181] of the independent Atlantic League ; and the Rutgers–Camden baseball team.

In June 2014, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they would move their practice facility and home offices to the Camden Waterfront, adding 250 permanent jobs in the city creating what CEO Scott O'Neil described as "biggest and best training facility in the country" using $82 million in tax savings offered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority . [184] [185] 

The Waterfront is also served by two modes of public transportation. NJ Transit serves the Waterfront on its River Line , while people from Philadelphia can commute using the RiverLink Ferry , which connects the Waterfront with Old City Philadelphia. [186] 

Riverfront State Prison , [187] was a state penitentiary located near downtown Camden north of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge , which opened in August 1985 having been constructed at a cost of $31 million. [188] The prison had a design capacity of 631 inmates, but housed 1,020 in 2007 and 1,017 in 2008. [189] The last prisoners were transferred in June 2009 to other locations and the prison was closed and subsequently demolished, with the site expected to be redeveloped by the State of New Jersey, the City of Camden, and private investors.

Morgan Quitno has ranked Camden as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in the United States since 1998, when they first included cities with populations less than 100,000. Camden was ranked as the third-most dangerous city in 2002. Camden was ranked as the most dangerous city overall in 2004 and 2005. [218] [219] It improved to the fifth spot for the 2006 and 2007 rankings but rose to number two in 2008 [220] [221] [222] and to the most dangerous spot in 2009. [223] Morgan Quitno based its rankings on crime statistics reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in six categories: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and auto theft. [224] In The Nation , journalist Chris Hedges describes Camden as "the physical refuse of postindustrial America", [225] plagued with homelessness, drug trafficking, prostitution, robbery, looting, constant violence, and an overwhelmed police force (which in 2011 lost nearly half of its officers to budget-related layoffs). [226] 

In 2005, reported homicides in Camden dropped to 34, 15 fewer murders than in 2004. [227] Though Camden's murder rate was still much higher than the national average, the reduction in 2005 was a drop of over 30%. In 2006, the number of murders climbed to 40. While murders fell by 10% across New Jersey in 2009, Camden's murder rate declined from 55 in 2008 down to 33, a drop of 40% that was credited to anti-gang efforts and more firearms seizures. [228] Despite significant cuts in the police department due to the city's fiscal difficulties, murders in 2009 and 2010 were both under 40, staying below the peak that had occurred in 2008, and continued to decline into early 2011. However, in 2012, the city's murder rate spiked and reached 62. [229] 

On October 29, 2012, the FBI announced Camden was ranked first in violent crime per capita of cities with over 50,000 residents, surpassing Flint, Michigan . [230] In December 2012, Camden residents surrendered approximately 1,137 firearms to two local churches over a two-day period. [231] Law enforcement [ edit ] 

In 2015, the Camden Police Department was operated by the state. [232] In 2011, it was announced that a county police department would be formed. [233] On May 1, 2013, the police department was disbanded and the newly created Camden County Police Department took over full responsibility for policing the city of Camden.

The governments of Guatemala and Mexico have established their consulates in the downtown area of the city. [8] 

California State University, San Bernardino is located in the northwestern part of the city. The university also hosts the Coussoulis Arena .

The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the San Bernardino Valley , which indigenous tribespeople originally referred to as "The Valley of the Cupped Hand of God". The Tongva Indians also called the San Bernardino area Wa'aach in their language. [15] Upon seeing the immense geological arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of the San Bernardino Mountains , they found the hot and cold springs to which the "arrowhead" seemed to point. 19th century [ edit ] San Bernardino, 1852 

The city of San Bernardino is one of the oldest communities in the state of California. Named for Bernardino of Siena on May 20, 1810, San Bernardino, in its present-day location, was not largely settled until 1851, after California became a state. The first Anglo-American colony was established by pioneers associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who would be recalled by Brigham Young in 1857 due to the Utah War . The city was officially incorporated in the year 1857. Soon afterward, San Bernardino became an important trading hub in Southern California . The city already on the Salt Lake Road became the starting point for the Bradshaw Trail and Mojave Road to the mines along the Colorado River and within the Arizona Territory in the gold rush of 1862-1864 . San Bernardino, 1865 

Near San Bernardino is a naturally formed arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of a mountain. It measures 1375 feet by 449 feet. According to the Native American legend regarding the landmark arrowhead, an arrow from heaven burned the formation onto the mountainside in order to show tribes where they could be healed. During the mid-19th century, "Dr." David Noble Smith claimed that a saint-like being appeared before him and told of a far-off land with exceptional climate and curative waters, marked by a gigantic arrowhead. Smith's search for that unique arrowhead formation began in Texas, and eventually ended at Arrowhead Springs in California in 1857. By 1889, word of the springs, along with the hotel on the site (and a belief in the effect on general health of the water from the springs) had grown considerably. Hotel guests often raved about the crystal-clear water from the cold springs, which prompted Seth Marshall to set up a bottling operation in the hotel's basement. By 1905, water from the cold springs was being shipped to Los Angeles under the newly created "Arrowhead" trademark . 

Indigenous people of the San Bernardino Valley and Mountains were collectively identified by Spanish explorers in the 19th century as Serrano , a term meaning highlander. Serrano living near what is now Big Bear Lake were called Yuhaviatam, or "People of the Pines". In 1866, to clear the way for settlers and gold miners, state militia conducted a 32-day campaign slaughtering men, women, and children. [16] Yuhaviatam leader Santos Manuel guided his people from their ancient homeland to a village site in the San Bernardino foothills. The United States government in 1891 established it as a tribal reservation and named it after Santos Manuel. 

In 1867, the first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Bernardino. 

In 1883, California Southern Railroad established a rail link through San Bernardino between Los Angeles and the rest of the country. San Bernardino, California, city and village, 1909. 20th century [ edit ] A view of "E" Street and the Stewart Hotel, San Bernardino, ca.1905 

In 1905, the city of San Bernardino passed its first charter. 

World War II brought Norton Air Force Base . 

In 1940, Richard and Maurice McDonald founded McDonald's , along with its innovative restaurant concept, in the city. [17] 

In 1980, the Panorama Fire destroyed 284 homes. In October 2003, another wildfire, the Old Fire, destroyed over 1,000 homes. 

San Bernardino won the All-America City award in the early 1980s, but the city subsequently went into general decline and has only recently begun to recover from the three recessions of the late 20th/early 21st centuries. 

In 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed to become San Bernardino International Airport . 21st century [ edit ] This section needs expansion with: City bankruptcy, 2015 shooting. You can help by adding to it .

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 59.6 square miles (154 km 2 ), of which 59.2 square miles (153 km 2 ) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km 2 ), or 0.74%, is water. 

The city lies in the San Bernardino foothills and the eastern portion of the San Bernardino Valley , roughly 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles. Some major geographical features of the city include the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Bernardino National Forest , in which the city's northernmost neighborhood, Arrowhead Springs, is located; the Cajon Pass adjacent to the northwest border; City Creek, Lytle Creek , San Timoteo Creek , Twin Creek, Warm Creek (as modified through flood control channels) feed the Santa Ana River , which forms part of the city's southern border south of San Bernardino International Airport . 

San Bernardino is unique among Southern Californian cities because of its wealth of water, which is mostly contained in underground aquifers. A large part of the city is over the Bunker Hill Groundwater Basin, including downtown . This fact accounts for an historically high water table in portions of the city, including at the former Urbita Springs, a lake which no longer exists and is now the site of the Inland Center Mall. Seccombe Lake, named after a former mayor, is a manmade lake at Sierra Way and 5th Street. The San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District ("Muni") has plans to build two more large, multi-acre lakes north and south of historic downtown in order to reduce groundwater, mitigate the risks of liquefaction in a future earthquake, and sell the valuable water to neighboring agencies.

The city has several notable hills and mountains; among them are: Perris Hill (named after Fred Perris, an early engineer, and the namesake of Perris, California ); Kendall Hill (which is near California State University); and Little Mountain, which rises among Shandin Hills (generally bounded by Sierra Way, 30th Street, Kendall Drive, and Interstate 215 ). 

Freeways act as significant geographical dividers for the city of San Bernardino. Interstate 215 is the major east-west divider, while State Route 210 is the major north-south divider. Interstate 10 is in the southern part of the city. Other major highways include State Route 206 (Kendall Drive and E Street); State Route 66 (which includes the former U.S. 66); State Route 18 (from State Route 210 north on Waterman Avenue to the northern City limits into the mountain communities), and State Route 259 , the freeway connector between State Route 210 and I-215. Climate [ edit ] January snowfall in San Bernardino with Shandin Hills in the background. near Verdemont and the University District 

San Bernardino features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate ( Csa in the Koeppen climate classification ) with mild winters and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer is also a lot warmer with the highest recorded summer temperature at 117 °F (47.2 °C) in 1971. [18] In the winter, snow flurries occur upon occasion. San Bernardino gets an average of 16 inches (406 mm) of rain, hail, or light snow showers each year. Arrowhead Springs , San Bernardino's northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times, due to its elevation of about 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level. 

The seasonal Santa Ana winds are felt particularly strongly in the San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby Cajon Pass at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothills, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

The neighborhoods of San Bernardino are not commonly named. Some reflect geographical regions that existed before annexation, and others originated with specific housing developments. Arrowhead Springs extends from the historic Arrowhead Springs Hotel and Spa in the north to I-210 in the south and from Shandin Hills in the west to east Twin Creek in the east. Del Rosa is the area generally between the foothills and Highland, Mountain and Arden Avenues. Delmann Heights is the area north of Highland Avenue, west of I-215, and east of the unincorporated area of Muscoy, California (which is within the city's sphere of influence for annexation). Some portions of Highland are within the city of San Bernardino, generally consistent with the portions of historical "West Highlands" north of Highland Avenue. The city also contains the post office for Patton, California, the area coextensive with Patton Hospital. Mountain Shadows is the development name for the area between Palm Avenue and Highland Avenue to State Route 330. The "West Side" is used generically to refer to the areas West of I-215. North Loma Linda is the area west of Mountain View Acres (the border with Redlands), south of the Santa Ana River, north of the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), and east of Tippecanoe Avenue. The area north of Northpark Boulevard from University Parkway to Electric Avenue, and the area north of 40th Street from Electric Avenue to Harrison Street is called Arrowhead Farms. The area west of University Parkway, and north of Kendall Drive to the north city area is called Verdemont . The "Bench" or "Rialto Bench" refers to the area with Rialto mailing addresses between Foothill Boulevard and Base Line Street. 

San Bernardino is divided into several districts. Many hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments have been built around Hospitality Lane [20] in the southern part of the city, creating an informal business district . Downtown is its own district with shopping and government buildings. In the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains lies the University District , which is a commercial area designed to support the California State University with shopping, dining, and high-density residential space. On the southern side of I-215 and the University District is the Cajon Pass light-industrial district where warehouses are situated to take advantage of this important connection between Southern California and the rest of the United States. On the opposite side of the city is the San Bernardino International Gateway, which encompasses the San Bernardino International Airport (SBD) and the Alliance California Logistics campus (air cargo hub). Nearby is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail hub. The combination of these assets (airport; rail hub; extensive freeway system; and, Cajon Pass) makes the city important in the movement of goods and people between Southern California and the rest of the United States.

The city of San Bernardino is in the process of developing an historic district around the 1918 Santa Fe Depot, which recently underwent a $15.6 million restoration. [ citation needed ] When completed, this area will connect to the downtown district with period street lights and street furniture, historic homes and other structures, a new museum, coffee bars and, a mercado with an architectural style in keeping with the Mission Revival station. 

San Bernardino has communities known for residences of millionaires and increasingly affluent sections of town: Del Rosa , University Heights (Kendall Farms) and University Hills , and Verdemont .

Western, central, and parts of eastern San Bernardino are home to mixed-ethnic low-income populations, of which the Latino and African-American populations dominate. Historically, many Latinos, primarily Mexican-Americans and Mexicans , lived on Mount Vernon Avenue on the West Side. [28] Since the 1960s, the Medical Center (formerly known as Muscoy ) and Base Line corridors were mostly black, in particular in the east side and west side areas centering on public housing projects Waterman Gardens and the public housing on Medical Center drive. The heart of the Mexican-American community is on the West and Southside of San Bernardino, but is slowly expanding throughout the entire city. [29] [30] San Bernardino's only Jewish congregation moved to Redlands in December 2009. [31] Some Asian Americans live in and around the city of San Bernardino, as in a late 19th-century-era (gone) Chinatown and formerly Japanese-American area in Seccombe Park on the east end of downtown, and a large East-Asian community in North Loma Linda . Others live in nearby Loma Linda to the south across the Santa Ana River. Economy [ edit ] 

Government, retail, and service industries dominate the economy of the city of San Bernardino. From 1998 to 2004, San Bernardino's economy grew by 26,217 jobs, a 37% increase, to 97,139.

[32] The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway intermodal freight transport yard 

The city's location close to the Cajon and San Gorgonio passes, and at the junctions of the I-10 , I-215, and SR-210 freeways, positions it as an intermodal logistics hub. The city hosts the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway 's intermodal freight transport yard, the Yellow Freight Systems' cross-docking trucking center, and Pacific Motor Trucking. Large warehouses for Kohl's , Mattel , Pep Boys , and Stater Bros. have been developed near the San Bernardino International Airport . [32] 

Over the last few decades, the city's riverfront district along Hospitality Lane has drawn much of the regional economic development away from the historic downtown of the city so that the area now hosts a full complement of office buildings, big-box retailers, restaurants, and hotels situated around the Santa Ana River.

The closing of Norton Air Force Base in 1994 resulted in the loss of 10,000 military and civilian jobs and sent San Bernardino's economy into a downturn that has been somewhat offset by more recent growth in the intermodal shipping industry. The jobless rate in the region rose to more than 12 percent during the years immediately after the base closing. As of 2007 households within one mile of the city core had a median income of only $20,480, less than half that of the Inland region as a whole. [33] Over 15 percent of San Bernardino residents are unemployed as of 2012, and over 40 percent are on some form of public assistance. [34] According to the US Census, 34.6 percent of residents live below the poverty level, making San Bernardino the poorest city for its population in California, and the second poorest in the US next to Detroit.

The city of San Bernardino is a charter city , a form of government under California that allows limited home-rule, in that it can pass its own laws not in conflict with state law, such as when state law is silent, or expressly allows municipal regulations of areas of local concern. San Bernardino became a charter city in 1905, the most current charter was passed in 2004. 

The city of San Bernardino has a full-time, elected mayor, a city manager , an elected City Attorney, City Clerk , and City Treasurer, and seven council positions elected in a ward system. The charter also created the San Bernardino City Unified School District , a legally separate agency, and the Board of Water Commissioners, a semi-autonomous, but legally indistinct commission, and a Board of Library Trustees. The City Manager is responsible for all department heads, except for the fire and police chiefs. Previously, the San Bernardino Municipal Code recognized a City Administrator. 

When the city originally adopted a ward system, there were five wards. In the 1960s, the Council was expanded to seven wards. The boundaries are adjusted with each federal census. The current council is: [2] Mayor: R. Carey Davis First Ward: Virginia Marquez Second Ward: Benito J. Barrios Third Ward: John Valdivia Fourth Ward: Fred Shorrett Fifth Ward: Henry Nickel Sixth Ward: Rikke Van Johnson Seventh Ward: James L. Mulvihill 

As per California law, all city positions are non-partisan . Bob Holcomb (1922–2010) was the longest serving Mayor of San Bernardino to date, holding the office from 1971 until 1985 and again from 1989 to 1993. [54] [55] 

San Bernardino's legal community has two centers: downtown and Hospitality Lane. Criminal, family, and government lawyers are centered downtown, while local civil firms and outposts of state and national firms, corporate, and insurance defense firms, are located along Hospitality Lane.

Citizens of Mexico can obtain a Matrícula Consular which many governments and businesses use in lieu of U.S. photo identification . Bankruptcy [ edit ] 

On July 10, 2012, the City Council of San Bernardino decided to seek protection under Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code , making it the third California municipality to do so in less than two weeks (after Stockton and the town of Mammoth Lakes ), and the second-largest ever. According to state law, the city would normally have to negotiate with creditors first, but, because they declared a fiscal emergency in June, that requirement did not apply. [11] [12] The case was filed on August 1. [14] Municipal code [ edit ] 

As a charter city , San Bernardino may make and enforce its own laws, as long as they are not in conflict with the State's laws. These rules have been codified as the San Bernardino Municipal Code . Violations of the code, punishable as a misdemeanor or infraction (or both) are prosecuted by the City Attorney's Office in the San Bernardino County Superior Court . The city also has two administrative processes for violations of the code, as well as other adopted codes, like the California Building Code and the California Fire Code . One process is an administrative citation system, similar to a parking ticket , with a pay or contest procedure. The other is an administrative hearing process, generally used by the Code Enforcement Department for prosecuting multiple code violations. City of San Bernardino Economic Development Agency [ edit ] 

The Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Bernardino, also known as the "Economic Development Agency of the City of San Bernardino," is a separate legal entity, though the City Council of the city of San Bernardino sits as the Agency Board, and the mayor is its executive. [ citation needed ] Downtown San Bernardino revitalization efforts [ edit ] 

In June 2009, the city's Economic Development Agency, presented the San Bernardino City Council with the Downtown Core Vision / Action Plan [56] – a guide for revitalizing Downtown San Bernardino for the next 10 years. The plan, which the city council approved to support, is the culmination of a year of research, community participation, and planning led by the city's EDA and the urban planning firm EDAW which has worked on master planning across the globe for downtown areas that include Milan, Italy; London, England; New York, New York; and Denver, Colorado, to name a few. 

A driving force in the initial phase of the revitalization efforts is the development of an arts and culture district in the heart of Downtown San Bernardino. [ citation needed ] This effort is being anchored by the historic and iconic California Theatre, [42] which has been in continuous operation since first opening its doors in 1928. California-based Maya Cinemas, which is adjacent to California Theatre, is in the process of renovating the former CinemaStar movie theatre. These two entertainment facilities are the foundation of what will become a vibrant center for the arts and culture. Joint-power authorities [ edit ] 

San Bernardino shares certain powers with other agencies to form legally separate entities known as joint-power authorities under California law. These include Omnitrans , which provides transportation throughout the east and west valleys of San Bernardino County, SANBAG, which coordinates transportation projects throughout the county, and the Inland Valley Development Agency, which is responsible for redevelopment of the areas around the San Bernardino International Airport . [ citation needed ] County seat [ edit ] San Bernardino County Court House, built in 1926. 

San Bernardino is the county seat of San Bernardino County , the largest formal county in the contiguous United States by area, but smaller than the informally organized county equivalent Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska and the formal county equivalent North Slope Borough, Alaska , as well as 4 other formal county equivalents and 5 other informally organized county equivalents in Alaska . Various state courts , (for civil, criminal and juvenile trials) operate under the auspices of the Superior Court , San Bernardino District (formerly Central Division prior to the unification of the Superior and Municipal Courts in 1998). Currently, the Superior Court of California county courthouse is located at 351 North Arrowhead Avenue. It consists of a four-story building of steel and concrete construction built in 1927. A six-story addition was added in the 1950s. Currently, the 1926 structure is being retrofitted. A new courthouse, located at 247 West Third Street, opened in 2014, which houses civil courts. 

Juvenile Court and Juvenile Hall are located in a county enclave adjacent to the city on Gilbert Street, near the site of the former County Hospital.

The 1905 Charter created the San Bernardino Police Department and chief of police; before 1905, there was a position of city marshal. The current charter places the chief of police under the direction of the mayor. 

The San Bernardino City Fire Department was founded in 1878 and dissolved on July 1, 2016 to be taken over by the San Bernardino County Fire District. [57] 

Charter Section 186 requires that the monthly salaries of police and fire local safety members be the average of like positions at ten comparable cities in California. [58] Thus, if the average goes up in other cities, the compensation of the local safety employees automatically rises. 

Over 90 percent of local police officers do not live within the city limits. [59] 

Recent police efforts include joint patrols with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol . As of November 2006, [60] Part 1 Crime (Murders, Rape, Robbery, Assault, Burglary and Theft) was down 14.07 percent from 2005. Stricter enforcement caused a rise in both juvenile and adult arrests. [61] 

San Bernardino has long battled high crime rates. According to statistics published by Morgan Quitno , San Bernardino was the 16th most dangerous US city in 2003, [62] 18th in 2004 [63] and 24th in 2005. San Bernardino's murder rate was 29 per 100,000 in 2005, the 13th highest murder rate in the country and the third highest in the state of California after Compton and Richmond . [64] Police efforts have significantly reduced crime in 2008 [65] and a major drop collectively since 1993 when the city's murder rate placed ninth in the nation. [66] Thirty two killings occurred in 2009, a number identical to 2008 and the lowest murder rate in San Bernardino since 2002, but only a third of cases led to arrests. [67] [68] According to findings by the U.S. Census Bureau , San Bernardino was among the most poverty-stricken cities in the nation, second nationally behind Detroit. [69] Jails [ edit ] 

The San Bernardino Police Department has a holding area, but pre-trial arrested suspects are transported to the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga . Sentenced criminals are held at the Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center, in the northern limits of the city in the Verdemont neighborhood. While the Central Detention Center, located at 630 East Rialto Avenue in San Bernardino, served as the main jail from 1971–1992, today it mostly serves federal prisoners under contract.

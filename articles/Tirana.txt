Tirana i / t ᵻ ˈ r ɑː n ə / (Standard Albanian : Tiranë ; regional Gheg Albanian : Tirona ) is the capital and largest city of Albania . It is the administrative, cultural, economic, and industrial center of Albania. 

The population of the city proper at the 2015 census was 610,070 [2] and the municipality of Tirana, created in 2015, has a total population of 800,986. [3] It is the biggest metropolitan area in Albania, and the only one with a population of over 500.000. The city is host to many public institutions and public and private universities, and is the centre of the political, economic, and cultural life of the country. The city is mostly surrounded by hills, with Dajti Mountain on the East and a slight valley opening on the North-West overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. 

The area occupied by Tirana has been populated since Paleolithic times dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years ago as suggested by evidence from tools found near Mount Dajt's quarry and in Pellumba Cave. As argued by various archaeologists, Tirana and its suburbs are filled with Illyrian toponyms as its precincts are some of the earliest regions in Albania to be inhabited. 

Tirana was founded as a city in 1614 although the area has been continuously inhabited since antiquity. An almost unimportant centre until the beginning of the 20th century, Tirana was proclaimed as the capital of Albania in 1920. The city planning and construction activity of Italian neighbors during the years 1930s until the capitulation of Fascism in 1943, provided to the city an axis and a look in the centre, which preserves its configuration even at the present days. The city centre and the Old Bazaar were destroyed during the communist regime, new arteries were opened and the central square, the Skanderbeg Square , was expanded. 

In 1703, Tirana had about 4,000 inhabitants and by 1820 the number tripled to 12,000. The first census conducted a few years after becoming capital showed a total population of 10,845. During the 1950s, Tirana is experiencing rapid industrial growth and the population increased to about 137,000. After the end of communist rule in 1991, Tirana experienced its fastest population growth when people from rural areas moved to the capital for better economic opportunities. In 1990, Tirana had 250,000 inhabitants, but the large-scale influx increased the population to well over 500,000. [4]

History [ edit ] Antiquity [ edit ] See also: Illyria and Illyrians The Cave of Pellumba 

The area occupied by Tirana has been populated since the Paleolithic era, [5] dating back 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, as suggested by evidence from tools excavated near Mount Dajt 's quarry and in Pellumba Cave. As argued by various archaeologists, Tirana and its suburbs are filled with Illyrian toponyms, as its precincts are some of the earliest inhabited regions in Albania. [6] The Illyrians called the settlement Tërana. [ citation needed ] 

The oldest discovery in downtown Tirana was a Roman house, later transformed into an aisleless church with a mosaic-floor, dating to the 3rd century A.D., with other remains found near a medieval temple at Shengjin Fountain in the eastern suburbs. A castle possibly called Tirkan or Theranda , whose remnants are found along Murat Toptani Street, was built by Emperor Justinian in 520 A.D. and restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century. [6] The area had no special importance in Illyrian and classical times. In 1510, Marin Barleti , an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg , Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis ( The story of life and deeds of Skanderbeg, the prince of Epirotes ), referred to this area as a small village. [7] Middle Ages and World War I [ edit ] Tirana before 1914 

Records from the first land registrations under the Ottomans in 1431–32 show that Tirana consisted of 60 inhabited areas, with nearly 2,028 houses and 7,300 inhabitants. [ citation needed ] Tirana is mentioned since 1572 as "Borgo di Tirana". [8] In 1614, Sulejman Bargjini , a local ruler, built the Old mosque , a small commercial centre, and a hammam (Turkish bath). Tirana Bazaar at the turn of the 20th century 

During this period, the Et'hem Bey Mosque , built by Molla Bey of Petrela , was constructed. It employed the best artisans in the country and was completed in 1821 by Molla's son Etëhem , who was also Sulejman Bargjini's grandnephew. In 1800, the first newcomers arrived in the settlement , the so-called ortodoksit . They were Vlachs from villages near Korçë and Pogradec , who settled around modern day Park on the Artificial Lake . [9] They started to be known as the llacifac and were the first Christians to arrive after the creation of the town. After Serb reprisals in the Debar region, thousands of locals fled to Tirana. In 1807, Tirana became the center of the Sub-Prefecture of Krujë-Tirana. After 1816, Tirana languished under the control of the Toptani family of Krujë . Later, Tirana became a Sub-Prefecture of the newly created Vilayet of Shkodër and Sanjak of Durrës. In 1889, the Albanian language started to be taught in Tirana's schools, while the patriotic club Bashkimi was founded in 1908. On 28 November 1912, the national flag was raised in agreement with Ismail Qemali . During the Balkan Wars , the town was temporarily occupied by the Serbian army and it took part in uprising of the villages led by Haxhi Qamili . In 1917, the first city outline was compiled by Austro-Hungarian architects. [ citation needed ] Monarchy [ edit ] Construction in central Tirana was part of the cooperation package between King Zog and Fascist Italy Tirana in 1923 

On 8 February 1920, the Congress of Lushnjë proclaimed Tirana as the temporary capital of Albania, which had gained independence in 1912. [10] The city retained that status permanently on 31 December 1925. In 1923, the first regulatory city plan was compiled by Austrian architects. [11] The centre of Tirana was the project of Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini , well known architects of the Benito Mussolini period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre. The plan underwent revisions by Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, Italian architect Castellani and Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. [ citation needed ] Modern Albanian parliamentary building served as a club of officers. It was there that, in September 1928, Zog of Albania was crowned King Zog I, King of the Albanians. Tirana served as the venue for the signing, between Fascist Italy and Albania, of the Pact of Tirana. World War II and Socialism [ edit ] Partisans entering Tirana in 1944 

In 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces appointing a puppet government . In the meantime, Italian architect Gherardo Bosio was asked to elaborate on previous plans and introduce a new project in the area of present-day Mother Teresa Square. [12] By the early 1940s, the southern portion of the main boulevard and surrounding buildings were finished and renamed with Fascist names. [ citation needed ] A failed assassination attempt was made on Victor Emmanuel III of Italy by a local resistance activist during a visit in Tirana. In November 1941, two emissaries of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ), Miladin Popović and Dušan Mugoša, managed to call a meeting of three Albanian communist groups and founded the Communist Party of Albania , of which Enver Hoxha would shortly emerge as the leader. 

The town soon became the center of the Albanian communists, who mobilized locals against Italian fascists and later Nazi Germans, while spreading ideological propaganda. On 17 November 1944, the town was liberated after a fierce battle between the Communists and German forces . [ citation needed ] The Nazis eventually withdrew and the communists seized power. Tirana's car-free main boulevard. In the evening, it turned into a big promenade known as the Xhiro 

From 1944 to 1991, the city experienced ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled apartment complexes and factories began to be built, while Skanderbeg Square was redesigned with a number of buildings being demolished. For instance, Tirana's former Old Bazaar and the Orthodox Cathedral were razed to the ground for the erection of the Soviet-styled Palace of Culture . The Italian-built municipal building was detonated and the National Historical Museum was constructed instead, while the structure housing the Parliament of Albania during the monarchy was turned into a children's theater. [ citation needed ] 

The northern portion of the main boulevard was renamed Stalin Boulevard and his statue erected in the city square. As private car ownership was banned, mass transport consisted mainly of bicycles, trucks and buses. After Hoxha's death, a pyramidal museum was constructed in his memory by the government. [ citation needed ] 

Prior to and after the proclamation of Albania's self-isolationist policy, a number of high-profile figures paid visits to the city, such as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev , Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer . In 1985, Tirana served as the ceremonial venue of Enver Hoxha's funeral. [ citation needed ] A few years later, Mother Teresa became the first religious figure [ citation needed ] to visit the country following Albania's long declared anti-religious atheist stance. She paid respect to her mother and sister resting at a local cemetery. Starting at the campus and ending at Skanderbeg Square with the toppling of Enver Hoxha's statue, the city saw significant demonstrations by University of Tirana students, demanding political freedoms in the early 1990s. Checkpoint memorial in Tirana featuring a bunker, walls from Spaç Prison , and a fragment of the Berlin Wall . Transition [ edit ] 

On the political aspect, the city witnessed a number of events. Personalities visited the capital, such as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Pope John Paul II . The former visit came amidst the historical setting after the fall of communism, as hundreds of thousands were chanting in Skanderbeg Square Baker's famous saying of "Freedom works!". Pope John Paul II became the first major religious leader to visit Tirana, though Mother Teresa had visited few years prior. 

During the Balkans turmoil in the mid-1990s, the city experienced dramatic events such as the unfolding of the 1997 unrest in Albania and a failed coup d'état on 14 September 1998. In 1999, following the Kosovo War , Tirana Airport became a NATO airbase, serving its mission in the former Yugoslavia. Recent development [ edit ] 

Starting in 2000, former Tirana mayor Edi Rama (mayor 2000 - 2011) under the Ilir Meta government, undertook a campaign to demolish illegal buildings around the city centre and on Lana River banks to bring the area to its pre-1990 state. In an attempt to widen roads, Rama authorized the bulldozing of private properties so that they could be paved over, thus widening streets. Most main roads underwent reconstruction, such the Ring Road (Unaza), Kavaja Street and the main boulevard. He has been accused of corruption and mismanagement of funds by the opposition, including corruption in the granting of building permits. Rama led the initiative to paint the façades of Tirana's buildings in bright colours (known as Edi Rama colours - very bright pink, yellow, green, violet) although much of their interiors continued to degrade. Rama's critics claimed that he focused too much attention on cosmetic changes without fixing any of the major problems such as shortages of drinking water and electricity. [13] [14] A richer calendar of events was introduced and a Municipal Police force established. 

In 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush marked the first time that such a high ranking American official visited Tirana. [15] A central Tirana street was named in his honor. In 2008, the 2008 Gërdec explosions were felt in the capital as windows were shattered and citizens shaken. On 21 January 2011, Albanian police clashed with opposition supporters in front of the Government building as cars were set on fire, three persons killed and 150 wounded. [16] Since 2005 the southeast region of Tirana, mainly Farke and Petrela has had a burst becoming the preferred destination with many residence complexes being built and having the current biggest mall in Albania, TEG. [17] [18] In the 2015 municipality election power was transferred from the Democratic Party of Albania, representative, Lulzim Basha, to the Socialist Party candidate Erion Veliaj. [19] The country underwent a territorial reform which unified communes with municipalities leaving 61 of them. [20] Thirteen of Tirana's communes were integrated as administrative units joining the existing eleven. [21] Since then Tirana is undergoing major changes in law enforcement and new projects as well as continuing the ones started by his predecessor. In their first few council meeting 242 social houses got allocated to needing families. [22] Construction permits were suspended until the capital's development plan is revised and synthesized. [21] In addition the municipality will audit all permits granted in the previous years. Geography [ edit ] 

The Municipality of Tirana is located at (41.33°N, 19.82°E) in Tirana County , about 32 kilometers (20 mi) inland. Tirana's average altitude is 110 meters (360 ft) above sea level and its highest point measures 1,828 m (5,997.38 ft) at Mali me Gropa. The city is mostly surrounded by hills, with Dajti Mountain on the east and a slight valley opening on the north-west overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. The Tiranë river runs through the city, as does the Lanë stream. 

The city has four artificial lakes: the Tirana Artificial Lake around which was built the Big Park , Paskuqani Lake, Farka Lake, Tufina Lake, and other smaller lakes or reservoirs.

Mount Dajt overlooking the city and accessible via cable car Climate [ edit ] 

Tirana has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the Köppen climate classification ) and receives just enough summer precipitation to avoid Köppen's Csa Mediterranean climate classification, since every summer month has more than 40 millimetres (1.6 in) of rainfall, [26] with hot and moderately dry/humid summers and cool and wet winters. Some snow falls almost every winter, but it usually melts quickly.

The city suffers from problems related to overpopulation , [30] such as waste management , high levels of air pollution and significant noise pollution . Over the last decades, air pollution has become a pressing concern as the number of cars has increased. These are mostly 1990s and early 2000s diesel cars, [31] while it is widely believed that the fuel used in Albania contains larger amounts of sulfur and lead than in the European Union . Another source of pollution are PM10 and PM2.5 inhaled particulate matter and NO2 gases [32] [33] resulting from rapid growth in the construction of new buildings and expanding road infrastructure. [34] Untreated solid waste is present in the city and outskirts. Additionally, there have been complaints of excessive noise pollution . Despite the problems, the Big Park at the Tirana Artificial Lake has some effect on absorbing CO 2 emissions, while over 2 000 trees have been planted around sidewalks. The work of four new parks began in the summer of 2015 located in: Kashar, Farke, Vaqarr, and Dajt. these parks are part of the new urban planning striving to increase the concentration of green spaces in the capital. [35] Administration [ edit ] See also: Administrative divisions of Tirana and List of Tirana's neighborhoods 

The Municipality of Tirana is divided into 24 administrative units referred to as Njësi Bashkiake/Administrative (Municipal/Administrative Units). These have their own appointed mayor and council, and sometimes are known as Mini-Bashki (Mini-Municipality). [36] 

In 2000, the centre of Tirana from the central campus of Tirana University up to Skanderbeg Square was declared the place of Cultural Assembly, and given state protection. The historical core of the capital lies around pedestrian only Murat Toptani Street, while the most prominent city district is Blloku. Borders of Tirana's 11 Administrative Divisions until 2015 

Until recently the city lacked a proper address system. In 2010, the municipality undertook the installing of street name signs and entrance numbers while every apartment entrance was physically stamped.

According to data from the National Census in 2011, the Urban areas of Tirana include 526,017 people. The rural areas of Tirana County , which are known as the suburbs of Tirana, include 223,348 people. Altogether, the figure for the whole county is counted as 749,365 people. The number of women slightly beats the number of men in the county, with 370,587 men, and 378,778 women. [44] Tirana is home to three main religious groups: Sunnite Muslims, Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians 

When it comes to religion , Muslims (including the large Bektashi minority in Albania) make up 65% of Tirana's population. About 11% of people in Tirana identify as some denomination of Christian , 3% are atheist , and 4% identify as "believers without denomination". An interesting stat in the religious makeup of Tirana is the 15% (113,000 people) who preferred not to answer the survey question. [44] This hesitance to not answer may come from the days of Communism in Albania under Enver Hoxha , where he famously proclaimed "The only religion for an Albanian is Albanianism," and then banned all organized religion in Albania.

Tirana is the economic heart of Albania and home to most major Albanian and international companies operating in the country. Tirana began to develop at the beginning of the 16th century, when a bazaar was established, and its craftsmen manufactured silk and cotton fabrics, leather, ceramics and iron, silver, and gold artifacts. Sited in a fertile plain, the Tirana area exported 2,600 barrels of olive oil and 14,000 packages of tobacco to Venice by 1769. [ citation needed ] In 1901, it had 140,000 olive trees, 400 oil mills, and 700 shops. [ citation needed ] 

Many, especially foreign, companies that operate in the country, have their headquarters in the city. The Central Bank of Albania , Raiffeisen Albania , Banka Kombetare Tregtare , American Bank of Albania , Credins Bank and Tirana Bank are based in Tirana. The three telecommunications providers Albanian Telecom , Vodafone Albania and Telekom Albania are located here. 

The ABA Business Center , the TID tower and the 4Ever Green Tower, an 80-metre (260-foot) business tower were being constructed in the city. Tirana has malls, such as City Park, QTU and Tirana East Gate . Transportation [ edit ] See also: Tirana–Elbasan Highway , A1 motorway (Albania) , and A3 motorway (Albania) The Tirana-Elbasan highway is currently under construction 

The city serves as the meeting point for national roads SH1, SH2 and SH3. Construction of the outer big ring highway started in 2011. 

National Road 1 (SH1) leads to the Albanian - Montenegrin border at Hani i Hotit border crossing. From Tirana at the Kamza Bypass (Mbikalimi i Kamzës) northward, it passes through Fushë-Kruja , Milot , Lezha , Shkodra , and Koplik. Between Thumane and Milot , the SH1 has become part of the Albania – Kosovo Highway connecting the capital Tirana with Kosovo . SH1 forms part of the Albanian North-South Corridor connecting Hani i Hotit border with Kakavijë in the Albanian - Greek border thus forming part of the Adriatic-Ionian motorway . 

National Road 2 (SH2) is a dual carriageway in Albania linking the port city of Durrës with Tirana. SH2 begins at the Port of Durrës in Durrës at the Dajlani Overpass, bypasses Shijak, intersects with SH52 in Vora, bypasses the road to Tirana International Airport , and ends at the Kamza Overpass in the outskirts of Tirana where it meets National Road 1 State Road heading to northern Albania. 

The Albanian Motorway Road A3 it is planned to run along the central corridor of Albania from Tirana to southern Albania, whose first part is the Tirana–Elbasan Highway connecting Tirana with the Pan-European Transport Corridor VIII . The section from Tirana to Elbasan, will be an alternative to the old curvy road SH3 along Krraba Pass. The new highway bypasses the heavy traffic via Durrës-Rrogozhina. In addition, the new track about 15 km shorter than the path to the SH3, resulting in drastically reduced distance with much higher speed between Tirana and Elbasan. Economically, after completion it will be an important link between the Albanian capital and Greece. Rail [ edit ] 

There are passenger services to Durrës and Librazhd , via Elbasan . As of September 2013, the Tirana Railway Station north of Skanderbeg Square was dismantled and moved to Kashar, the latter renovated in May 2015. [ citation needed ] The existing line was replaced with a bus service located alongside the coach terminal at the north end of Boulevard Zogu I. The line extending from Librazhd to Pogradec was discontinued in 2012. There are no international passenger services, although there is a freight-only railway through Shkodër to Montenegro . 

In the northwestern district of Tirana, Laprakë a new station will be built, which is planned as a multi-functional terminal for railway, tram and bus. Until its opening, the railway transport between Tirana and Kashar remains closed. [47] The terminal of the Airport Airport [ edit ] 

Tirana International Airport is Albania's only international airport and is located close to the country's capital Tirana. The airport is located in the village of Rinas 6 nautical miles (11 kilometres; 6.9 miles) northwest [48] of Tirana. The Airport has flights to numerous European destinations. Among the companies that fly from there are Aegean Airlines , Austrian Airlines , British Airways , Eurowings , Lufthansa , Pegasus Airlines , Transavia France and Turkish Airlines . The destinations are mainly European. It is an international airport that handles over 1.9 million passengers per year. It is the only port of entry for air travelers to Albania. Tirana International Airport is a focus city for Adria Airways of Slovenia, Alitalia and Blue Panorama Airlines of Italy. The airport is named after Mother Teresa , Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. Public Bus Transport Sea [ edit ]

Passenger ferries from Durrës sail to Trieste , Ancona , Otranto , Brindisi , Bari , Genoa ( Italy ), Zadar , Dubrovnik ( Croatia ), Koper ( Slovenia ), Bar ( Montenegro ), Corfu ( Greece ) and others. Kavaja is included in the Tirana County also. Bus [ edit ]

Coach and minibus ( furgon ) services also run to the coast and northern and southern Albania from Tirana. International coach services connect to Greece, via Korçë or Kakavije, to Kosovo [note 2] via the new Durrës-Morine highway , and to the Republic of Macedonia via Struga . Ecovolis Bicycle sharing scheme Future Tram Project [ edit ] 

In 2012, Tirana municipality published a report according to which a project on the construction of two tram lines was under evaluation. The tram lines would have a total length of 16.7 km. The public transport in Tirana is, for now, focused only in the city centre, so that the people living in the suburbs have fewer or no public transport connections. The municipality believes that pedestrian areas in the city centre will also be created with the construction of the tram lines. Under the plan, the two tram lines will intersect in the Skanderbeg Square . The current public transport system in Tirana is made of ten bus lines served by 250 to 260 buses every day. The development of the tram network will provide an easier access to the city centre and beyond to necessary facilities, such as leisure areas or jobs without using personal vehicles. [49] Bicycle [ edit ] See also: Ecovolis 

The Ecovolis bicycle sharing system was launched in 2011. [50] Bicycles are rented from initially four stations located at Rinia Park and along Deshmoret e Kombit Boulevard. A full day ride costs 100 leks. Bike only lanes are located alongside existing sidewalks on Skanderbeg Square, Lana River and Kavaja Street, while combined bus and bike lanes are located on other main streets to alleviate overall congestion. Culture [ edit ] 

The center of Tirana was conceived as a monumental space. To achieve this goal, the old bazaar of Tirana, the City hall, the Orthodox Cathedral and an old assemble of shops, hotels, bars and traditional houses were demolished and substituted by important buildings such as the Palace of Culture, Hotel Tirana, National Museum, "Scanderbeg Square", and a group of residential buildings. The only historical objects that were taken under protection were the Mosque of Et'hem Bey and the Old Clock Tower as well as the Complex of Ministries. Now, it includes the National Library and the National Opera and Ballet of Albania. The city serves as a venue for the Tirana Biennale, Tirana Jazz Festival, Summer Day , White Night on 28 November, Rally Albania, Buy Albanian Regional Delicacies Expo, and Tirana Fashion Week.

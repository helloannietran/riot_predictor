Louisville (pronounced i / ˈ l uː ə v əl / , i / ˈ l ʌ v əl / or i / ˈ l uː iː v ɪ l / ) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the 30th-most populous city in the United States. [d] [5] It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated as first-class , the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington . [e] Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of Jefferson County . 

Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named after King Louis XVI of France , making Louisville one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains . Sited beside the Falls of the Ohio , the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico , the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , which grew into a 6,000-mile (9,700 km) system across 13 states. Today, the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby , Kentucky Fried Chicken , the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six Fortune 500 companies. [13] Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service 's worldwide air hub . 

Since 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger . [14] The official name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government , [15] abbreviated to Louisville Metro . [16] Despite the merger and renaming, the term "Jefferson County" continues to be used in some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including the incorporated cities outside the " balance " which make up Louisville proper. The city's total consolidated population as of the 2014 census estimate was 760,026. [4] However, the balance total of 612,780 [5] excludes other incorporated places and semiautonomous towns within the county and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings. 

The Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), sometimes also referred to as Kentuckiana, [17] [18] includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 surrounding counties , seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana . As of 2014, the MSA had a population of 1,269,702, [8] ranking 43rd nationally . [a]

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Louisville, Kentucky and Timeline of Louisville, Kentucky See also: History of Kentucky and National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Kentucky 

The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area's geography and location. Early history and founding [ edit ] Louisville's founder, George Rogers Clark 

The rapids at the Falls of the Ohio created a barrier to river travel, and as a result, settlements grew up at this stopping point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on Corn Island in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the community are named after him. [19] 

Two years later, in 1780, the Virginia General Assembly approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was named in honor of King Louis XVI of France , whose soldiers were then aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War . Early residents lived in forts to protect themselves from Indian raids, but moved out by the late 1780s. [20] In 1803, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark organized their expedition across America in the town of Clarksville, Indiana at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky. [21] [22] 19th century [ edit ] See also: Louisville, Kentucky, in the American Civil War View of Main Street Louisville in 1846 

The city's early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had swelled to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city. The city grew rapidly in its formative years. [23] 

Louisville was a major shipping port and slaves worked in a variety of associated trades. The city was often a point of escape for slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state. Memorial to the 1890 tornado , on Main Street in downtown Louisville 

During the Civil War , Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces , which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater . By the end of the war, Louisville had not been attacked, although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Perryville and Corydon , took place nearby. After Reconstruction, returning Confederate veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over. Churchill Downs in 1901 

The first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed Churchill Downs ). The Derby was originally shepherded by Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr. , the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers Clark. Horse racing had a strong tradition in Kentucky, whose Inner Bluegrass Region had been a center of breeding high-quality livestock throughout the 19th century. Ten thousand spectators watched the first Derby, which Aristides won. [24] 

On March 27, 1890, the city was devastated and its downtown nearly destroyed when an F4 tornado tore through as part of the middle Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak . An estimated 74 to 120 people were killed. 20th and 21st centuries [ edit ] 

Throughout January 1937, 19.17 inches (48.7 cm) of rain fell in Louisville, and by January 27, the Ohio River crested at a record 57.15 feet (17.42 m), almost 30 feet (9.1 m) above flood stage. These events triggered the "Great Flood of 1937" , which lasted into early February. The flood submerged 60–70% of the city, caused complete loss of power for four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending on sources. Ninety people died as a result of the flood. [25] [26] It led to dramatic changes in where residents lived. Today, the city is protected by numerous flood walls . After the flood, the areas of high elevation in the eastern part of the city had decades of residential growth. 

Louisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to International Harvester , which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Louisville's population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black. [27] 

Similar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.

In 1974, a major (F4) tornado hit Louisville as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states. It covered 21 miles (34 km) and destroyed several hundred homes in the Louisville area. Only two people died. [28] 

Since the 1980s, many of the city's urban neighborhoods have been revitalized into areas popular with young professionals and college students. The greatest change has occurred along the Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue and Frankfort Avenue corridors as well as the Old Louisville neighborhood. In recent years, such change has also occurred in the East Market District (NuLu). 

Since the late 1990s, Downtown has experienced significant residential, tourist and retail growth, including the addition of major sports complexes KFC Yum! Center and Louisville Slugger Field , conversion of waterfront industrial sites into Waterfront Park , openings of varied museums (see Museums, galleries and interpretive centers below), and the refurbishing of the former Galleria into the bustling entertainment complex Fourth Street Live! , which opened in 2004. Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Louisville, Kentucky Hilly terrain blankets the southwest part of the city 

Louisville and Jefferson County have a combined area of 397.68 square miles (1,030.0 km 2 ), of which 380.46 square miles (985.4 km 2 ) is land and 17.23 square miles (44.6 km 2 ) (4.33%) is covered by water. [7] 

Louisville is southeasterly situated along the border between Kentucky and Indiana , the Ohio River , in north-central Kentucky at the Falls of the Ohio . Although situated in a Southern state , Louisville is influenced by both Southern and Midwestern culture . It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost Northern cities in the United States. [29] [30] 

Louisville is located in Kentucky's outer Bluegrass region . [31] Its development has been influenced by its location on the Ohio River, which spurred Louisville's growth from an isolated camp site into a major shipping port. Much of the city is located on a very wide and flat floodplain surrounded by hill country on all sides. Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent flooding and disease outbreaks. 

Areas generally east of I-65 are above the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped Knobs region , which is home to Jefferson Memorial Forest . 

The Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 43rd largest in the United States, [a] [8] includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson ( coterminous with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties—seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana . Louisville's MSA is included in the Louisville–Elizabethtown–Madison, KY–IN Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which also includes the Elizabethtown, KY MSA, as well as the Madison, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area . 

The Louisville area is near several other urban areas, especially Frankfort, Kentucky (the state's capital), Cincinnati, Ohio (the two cities' metropolitan statistical areas almost border each other), Lexington, Kentucky , and the Indianapolis, Indiana area (especially Columbus, Indiana , to the north of Southern Indiana).

The downtown business district of Louisville is located immediately south of the Ohio River and southeast of the Falls of the Ohio. Major roads extend outwards from the downtown area in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel. The airport is about 6.75 miles (10.86 km) south of the downtown area. The industrial sections of town are to the south and west of the airport, while most of the residential areas of the city are to the southwest, south, and east of downtown. In 2010, the 22,000-seat KFC Yum! Center was completed. [32] [33] Twelve of the 15 buildings in Kentucky over 300 feet (91 m) are located in downtown Louisville. 

Another primary business and industrial district is located in the suburban area east of the city on Hurstbourne Parkway. [34] 

Louisville's late 19th- and early 20th-century development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges of the city in 1890. 

The city's architecture contains a blend of old and new. The Old Louisville neighborhood is the largest historic preservation district solely featuring Victorian homes and buildings in the United States; [35] [36] it is also the third-largest such district overall. Many modern skyscrapers are located downtown, as well as older preserved structures, such as the Southern National Bank building. The buildings of West Main Street in downtown Louisville have the largest collection of cast iron facades of anywhere outside of New York's SoHo district.

Since the mid-20th century, Louisville has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a University of Louisville geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north of Algonquin Parkway, is "a euphemism for the African American part of town" although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents are black. Nevertheless, he says the perception is still strong. [38] The South End has long had a reputation as a white, working-class part of town, while the East End has been seen as middle and upper class . [39] 

According to the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors, the area with the lowest median home sales price is west of Interstate 65, in the West and South Ends, the middle range of home sales prices are between Interstates 64 and 65 in the South and East Ends, and the highest median home sales price are north of Interstate 64 in the East End. [40] Immigrants from Southeast Asia tend to settle in the South End, while immigrants from Eastern Europe settle in the East End. [41] Panoramic views [ edit ] Climate [ edit ] 

Louisville has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa ) with four distinct seasons and is located in USDA hardiness zones 6b and 7a. [11] Spring-like conditions typically begin in mid-to-late March, summer from mid-to-late-May to late September, with fall in the October–November period. Seasonal extremes in both temperature and precipitation are not uncommon during early spring and late fall; severe weather is not uncommon, with occasional tornado outbreaks in the region. Winter typically brings a mix of rain, sleet, and snow, with occasional heavy snowfall and icing. Louisville averages 4.5 days with low temperatures dipping to 10 °F (−12 °C); [42] the first and last freezes of the season on average fall on November 2 and April 5, respectively. [43] Summer is typically hazy, hot, and humid with long periods of 90–100 °F (32–38 °C) temperatures and drought conditions at times. Louisville averages 38 days a year with high temperatures at or above 90 °F (32 °C). The mean annual temperature is 58.2 °F (14.6 °C), with an average annual snowfall of 12.7 inches (32 cm) and an average annual rainfall of 44.9 inches (1,140 mm). 

The wettest seasons are spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant year round. During the winter, particularly in January and February, several days of snow can be expected. January is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of 34.9 °F (1.6 °C). July is the average hottest month with a mean of 79.3 °F (26.3 °C). [44] The highest recorded temperature was 107 °F (42 °C), which last occurred on July 14, 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature was −22 °F (−30 °C) on January 19, 1994. [45] In 2012, Louisville had the fourth-hottest summer on record, with the temperature rising up to 106 °F (41 °C) in July and the June all-time monthly record high temperature being broken on two consecutive days. [43] As the city exemplifies the urban heat island effect, temperatures in commercial areas and in the industrialized areas along interstates are often higher than in the suburbs, often as much as 5 °F (2.8 °C). 

Air pollution is trapped in Louisville's Ohio River Valley location. The city is ranked by Environmental Defense as America's 38th-worst city for air quality.

[5] Due to the city-county merger in 2003, the city's population had greatly expanded from the premerger area of Louisville, which held only 245,315 people in 2007. 

Louisville is the largest city in Kentucky, with 17.1% of the state's total population as of 2010; the balance's percentage was 13.8%. [51] In 2010, over one-third of the population growth in Kentucky was in Louisville's CSA counties. [ citation needed ]

Religion [ edit ] Main article: Religion in Louisville, Kentucky See also: Religion in Kentucky Louisville's Cathedral of the Assumption 

Louisville hosts religious institutions of various faiths, including Christianity , Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism , and Sikhism . 

The 135,421 Roman Catholic Louisvillians are part of the Archdiocese of Louisville , covering 24 counties in central Kentucky, and consisting of 121 parishes and missions spread over 8,124 square miles (21,040 km 2 ). [52] The Cathedral of the Assumption in downtown Louisville is the seat of the Archdiocese of Louisville. Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey , the monastic home of Catholic writer Thomas Merton , is in nearby Bardstown, Kentucky , and also in the archdiocese. Most of Louisville's Roman Catholic population is of German descent, the result of large-scale 19th-century immigration. 

Bellarmine University and Spalding University in Louisville are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. 

One in three Louisvillians is Southern Baptist , belonging to one of 147 local congregations. [53] This denomination increased in number when large numbers of people moved into Louisville in the early 20th century from rural Kentucky and Tennessee to work in the city's factories; some of these migrants also formed Holiness and Pentecostal churches and Churches of Christ . 

German immigrants in the 19th century brought not only a large Catholic population, but also the Lutheran and Evangelical faiths, which are represented today in Louisville by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America , the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod , and the United Church of Christ , respectively. 

The city is home to several megachurches . Southeast Christian Church , with its main campus in Middletown and three others in the surrounding region, is the fifth-largest of the Christian churches in the United States, and St. Stephen Baptist Church [54] has the largest African American congregation. [ clarification needed ] 

The city is home to several religious institutions: the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , Louisville Bible College , Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary , and the denominational headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (USA) . 

The Jewish population of around 8,500 in the city is served by five synagogues . Most Jewish families emigrated from Eastern Europe at the start of the 20th century; around 800 Soviet Jews have moved to Louisville since 1991. [55] Jewish immigrants founded Jewish Hospital in what was once the center of the city's Jewish district. From 2005–2012, Jewish Hospital merged with two Kentucky-based Catholic healthcare systems to form KentuckyOne Health , which later in 2012 announced a partnership with the University of Louisville Hospital. A significant focal point for Louisville's Jewish community is located near Bowman Field , where there are two Orthodox synagogues (including Anshei Sfard , founded in 1893), the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Family and Career Services, and an affordable housing complex. 

Since 1996, every May, the Festival of Faiths, [56] a five-day national interfaith gathering, is held featuring music, poetry, film, art and dialogue with internationally renowned spiritual leaders, thinkers and practitioners.

Louisville today is home to dozens of companies and organizations across several industrial classifications . However, the underpinning of the city's economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, and its unique position in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60% of the cities in the continental U.S.) make it a practical location for the transfer of cargo along its route to other destinations. [60] The Louisville and Portland Canal and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad were important links in water and rail transportation. 

Louisville's importance to the shipping industry continues today with the presence of the Worldport global air-freight hub for UPS at Louisville International Airport . Louisville's location at the crossroads of three major interstate highways ( I-64 , I-65 , and I-71 ) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the shipping and cargo industry. As of 2003, Louisville ranks as the seventh-largest inland port in the United States. [61] 

Louisville has emerged as a major center for the health care and medical sciences industries. It has been central to advancements in heart and hand surgery , as well as cancer treatment . Some of the earliest artificial heart transplants were conducted in Louisville. Its thriving downtown medical research campus includes a new $88 million rehabilitation center and a health sciences research and commercialization park, that in partnership with the University of Louisville , has lured nearly 70 top scientists and researchers. Louisville is also home to Humana , one of the nation's largest health insurance companies.

Louisville for a long time was also home to the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company , at its peak one of the largest manufacturers and wholesale distributors of hardware in the United States, as well as Brown Williamson , the third-largest company in the tobacco industry before merging with R. J. Reynolds in 2004 to form the Reynolds American Company. Brown Williamson, one of the subjects of the tobacco industry scandals of the 1990s, was the focus of The Insider , a 1999 film shot around the Louisville area. Also located in Louisville are two major Ford plants, the headquarters of GE Appliances Lighting (a subsidiary of General Electric ), and a major General Electric appliance factory. 

Louisville is a major center of the American whiskey industry, with about one-third of all bourbon coming from Louisville. [62] [63] [64] [65] Brown-Forman , one of the major makers of American whiskey, is headquartered in Louisville and operates a distillery in the Louisville suburb of Shively . The current primary distillery site operated by Heaven Hill , called the Bernheim distillery, is also located in Louisville near Brown-Forman's distillery. Other distilleries and related businesses can also be found in neighboring cities in Kentucky, such as Bardstown , Clermont , Lawrenceburg , and Loretto . Similar to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that links these central Kentucky locations, Louisville offers tourists its own "Urban Bourbon Trail", [66] where people can stop at nearly 20 "area bars and restaurants, all offering at least 50 labels of America's only native spirit." [64] 

Louisville prides itself in its large assortment of small, independent businesses and restaurants, some of which have become known for their ingenuity and creativity. In 1926, the Brown Hotel became the home of the Hot Brown "sandwich". A few blocks away, the Seelbach Hotel , which F. Scott Fitzgerald references in The Great Gatsby , is also famous for a secret back room where Al Capone would regularly meet with associates during the Prohibition era. The drink the Old Fashioned was invented in Louisville's Pendennis Club . 

Several major motion pictures have also been filmed in or near Louisville, including The Insider , Goldfinger , Stripes , Lawn Dogs , Elizabethtown , and Secretariat .

Louisville has blossomed as a booming center for independent art, music and business. 

A Louisville locale that highlights this scene is Bardstown Road , an area located in the heart of the Highlands . Bardstown Road is known for its cultural diversity and local trade. The majority of the businesses along Bardstown Road, such as coffee shops, clothing stores and art galleries, are locally owned and operated businesses. Though it is only about one mile (1.6 km) long, this strip of Bardstown Road constitutes much of the city's culture and diverse lifestyle, contributing to the unofficial " Keep Louisville Weird " slogan.

Especially catering to Louisville's music scene is 91.9 WFPK Radio Louisville, a local public radio station funded, in part, from local listeners. The station features not only national and international musicians common to public radio, but also local and regional talent. The station also hosts summer concerts on the waterfront from April until July, where up-and-coming alternative artists are brought to stage.

Government and politics [ edit ] Louisville City Hall in downtown , built 1870–1873, is a blend of Italianate styles characteristic of Neo-Renaissance Main article: Government of Louisville, Kentucky See also: List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky and Louisville Metro Council 

On January 6, 2003, Louisville merged its government with that of Jefferson County, forming coterminous borders. [14] Louisville was the second and only other city in the state to merge with its county since Lexington merged with Fayette County in 1974. 

Louisville Metro is governed by an executive called the Metro Mayor and a city legislature called the Metro Council . The second and current Metro Mayor is Greg Fischer ( D ), who entered office on January 3, 2011. 

The Metro Council consists of 26 seats representing districts apportioned by population throughout the city and county. The residents of the semi-independent municipalities within Louisville Metro are apportioned to districts along with all other county residents. Half (13) of the seats come up for reelection every two years. The council is chaired by a Council President , currently David Yates (D), who is elected by the council members annually. Democrats currently have a 17 to 9 seat majority on the council. 

Before merger, under the Kentucky Constitution and statutory law Louisville was designated as a first-class city in regard to local laws affecting public safety, alcohol beverage control, revenue options, and various other matters; as of 2014, it is the only such designated city in the state. [82] 

The Official Seal of the City of Louisville, no longer used following the merger, reflected its history and heritage in the fleur-de-lis representing French aid given during the Revolutionary War and the thirteen stars signifying the original colonies. The new Seal of Louisville Metro retains the fleur-de-lis, but has only two stars, one representing the city and the other the county. 

Kentucky's 3rd congressional district encompasses most of Louisville Metro, and is represented by Rep. John Yarmuth (D). Far eastern portions of the county are part of the 4th congressional district , which is represented by Thomas Massie ( R ).

Fire protection, which is not solely a Metro government function, is provided by 20 independent fire departments (most of which are autonomous taxing districts) working in concert through mutual aid agreements. The only fire department operated by metro government is Louisville Fire Rescue (formerly Louisville Division of Fire before city-county merger in 2003). The independent city of Shively in western Jefferson County possesses a city-run department. The other 18 fire departments in Louisville-Jefferson County are taxing districts known collectively as the Jefferson County Fire Service .

There are six four-year universities, the University of Louisville , Bellarmine University , Boyce College , Spalding University , Sullivan University and Simmons College of Kentucky ; Louisville Bible College ; a two-year community college, Jefferson Community and Technical College ; and several other business or technical schools such as Spencerian College , ITT Technical Institute , Strayer University and Sullivan College of Technology and Design . Indiana University Southeast is located across the Ohio River in New Albany, Indiana . 

The University of Louisville has had notable achievements including several hand transplants [93] and the world's first self-contained artificial heart transplant. [94] The school's Health Sciences Center in Downtown Louisville is currently adding an expansive medical research market on the city's old Haymarket site, which is projected to add 10,000 high paying jobs within 10 years.

Two major graduate-professional schools of religion are also located in Louisville. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , with more than 2,000 students, is the flagship institution of the Southern Baptist Convention . It was founded in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1859 and moved to Louisville in 1877, occupying its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926. Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary , product of a 1901 merger of two predecessor schools founded at Danville, Kentucky in 1853 and in Louisville in 1893, occupied its present campus on Alta Vista Road in 1963. 

According to the U.S. Census , of Louisville's population over 25, 21.3% (the national average is 24%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher and 76.1% (80% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent. 

The public school system, Jefferson County Public Schools , consists of more than 100,000 students in 173 schools. [95] Due to Louisville's large Catholic population, there are 27 Catholic schools in the city. The Kentucky School for the Blind , for all of Kentucky's blind and visually impaired students, is located on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood. Media [ edit ] Main article: Media in Louisville, Kentucky 

Louisville's newspaper of record is The Courier-Journal . The alternative paper is the progressive alt-weekly Louisville Eccentric Observer (commonly called 'LEO'), which was founded by 3rd district U.S. Representative John Yarmuth ( D ). 

WAVE 3 , an NBC affiliate, was Kentucky's first TV station. Another prominent TV station is ABC affiliate WHAS 11 , formerly owned by the famous Bingham family (who also owned The Courier-Journal ), which hosts the regionally notable annual fundraiser, the WHAS Crusade for Children . CBS affiliate WLKY 32 and Fox affiliate WDRB 41 (along with its sister stations WMYO and WBKI ) round out the major television stations in the city. 

The most popular radio station is 84 WHAS 840 AM, designated by the FCC as a clear-channel station . This station was also formerly owned by the Binghams (now iHeartMedia ), and is a talk radio station which also broadcasts regional sports. Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] Main article: Transportation in Louisville, Kentucky See also: Roads in Louisville, Kentucky 

As with most American cities, transportation in Louisville is based primarily on automobiles. However, the city traces its foundation to the era where the river was the primary means of transportation , and railroads have been an important part of local industry for over a century. In more recent times, Louisville has become an international hub for air cargo . Overhead view of the Kennedy Interchange ("Spaghetti Junction") before the ongoing reconstruction as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project . 

Louisville has inner and outer interstate beltways, I-264 and I-265 respectively. Interstates I-64 and I-65 pass through Louisville, and I-71 has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of downtown , this spot has become known as " Spaghetti Junction ". Two bridges carry I-64 and I-65 over the Ohio River, and a third automobile bridge carries non-interstate traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown is the Big Four Bridge , a former railroad bridge now renovated as a pedestrian bridge. 

The Ohio River Bridges Project , a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012. [96] One bridge, the Abraham Lincoln Bridge , is located downtown beside the existing Kennedy Bridge for relief of I-65 traffic. The other, currently dubbed the East End Crossing, will connect I-265 between the portions located in southeast Clark County, Indiana and northeast Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville Metro). [97] Both bridges and corresponding construction are slated to be finished sometime in 2016. [98] [99] As with any major project, there have been detractors and possible alternatives; one grassroots organization, 8664.org , has proposed options for downtown revitalization improvements, and a simpler and less expensive roadway design. Louisville International Airport 

Louisville's main airport is the centrally located Louisville International Airport , whose IATA Airport Code (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford Field. The airport is also home to UPS 's Worldport global air hub. UPS operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport and bases its UPS Airlines division there. Over 3.2 million passengers and over 4.7 billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport each year. [100] It is also the third busiest airport in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and seventh busiest for such in the world. [101] Furthermore, since Louisville is located only around 35 minutes from Fort Knox , the airport is a major hub for armed services personnel traveling to and from the military installation. The historic but smaller Bowman Field is used mainly for general aviation while nearby Clark Regional Airport is used mostly by private jets. 

The McAlpine Locks and Dam is located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks were constructed to allow shipping past the Falls of the Ohio . In 2001 over 55 million tons of commodities passed through the locks. Toonerville II Trolleys provided transportation in downtown Louisville up through 2014, before being replaced by ZeroBus. 

Public transportation consists mainly of buses run by the Transit Authority of River City (TARC). The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and Jefferson County , as well as Kentucky suburbs in Oldham County , Bullitt County , and the Indiana suburbs of Jeffersonville , Clarksville and New Albany . In addition to regular city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts is served by a fleet of zero-emissions buses called ZeroBus. In late 2014, these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the Toonerville II Trolley . [102] A light rail system has been studied and proposed for the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007. [103] 

Louisville has historically been a major center for railway traffic. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by CSX Transportation . Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, CSX (with a major classification yard in the southern part of the metro area) and Norfolk Southern . Five major main lines connect Louisville to the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the Paducah and Louisville Railway and the Louisville and Indiana Railroad , also serve the city. With the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly route between New York and Chicago, the Kentucky Cardinal no longer serves the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger rail service. [104] 

A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Louisville 41st most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. [105] Utilities [ edit ] Completed in 1860, the Louisville Water Tower is the oldest water tower in the U.S. 

Electricity is provided to the Louisville Metro area by Louisville Gas Electric . Water is provided by the Louisville Water Company , which provides water to more than 800,000 residents in Louisville as well as parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties. Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of Shelby , Spencer and Nelson . [106] 

The Ohio River provides for most of the city's source of drinking water . Water is drawn from the river at two points: the raw water pump station at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of Harrods Creek . Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two water treatment plants serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the "Best of the Best" award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country. [107] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from the Louisville metropolitan area See also: List of University of Louisville people Events [ edit ] 

Important events occurring in the city have included the first large space lighted by Edison's light bulb which occurred during the Southern Exposition . (At the time, in 1883, the largest such installation to date.) Also, Louisville had the first library open to African Americans in the South, [108] [109] and medical advances including the first human hand transplant [93] and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant. [94] Sister cities [ edit ] The distances to each of Louisville's sister cities are represented on this downtown light post. 

Louisville has nine sister cities as of 2012: [110] [111] [112] Adapazarı , Turkey Jiujiang , Jiangxi , China La Plata , Argentina Leeds , West Yorkshire , United Kingdom Mainz , Germany Montpellier , France Perm , Russia Quito , Ecuador Tamale , Ghana 

In addition, Leeds has been recognized as a "friendship city". The two cities have engaged in many cultural exchange programs, particularly in the fields of nursing and law, and cooperated in several private business developments, including the Frazier History Museum . [113] 

On April 15, 2008, it was announced that Louisville would be twinned with the town of Bushmills in Northern Ireland . The two places share a tradition for the distilling of whiskey . The choice of Louisville came after a search of U.S. cities, followed by an online poll conducted for the public to decide between three finalists, which also included Boston and Portland, Maine .

This replaced a system in which cities were divided into six classes, nominally by population.

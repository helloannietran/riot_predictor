Manhattan is a city in northeastern Kansas in the United States at the junction of the Kansas River and Big Blue River . It is the county seat [6] of Riley County , although it extends into Pottawatomie County . As of the 2010 census , the city population was 52,281. [7] 

The city was founded by settlers from the New England Emigrant Aid Company as a Free-State town in the 1850s, during the Bleeding Kansas era. Nicknamed "The Little Apple" as a play on New York City's " Big Apple ", Manhattan is best known as the home of Kansas State University and has a distinct college town atmosphere. 

Manhattan Regional Airport (MHK) is the second-busiest commercial airport in Kansas. Eight miles (13 km) west of the city is Fort Riley , a United States Army post.

Before settlement by European-Americans in the 1850s, the land where Manhattan sits was home to Native American tribes. [8] Most recently, from 1780 to 1830 it was home to the Kaw people (also known as the Kansa). [8] The Kaw settlement was called Blue Earth Village (Manyinkatuhuudje). [8] It was named after the river the tribe called the Great Blue Earth River – today known as the Big Blue River – which intersected with the Kansas River by their village. [8] Blue Earth Village was the site of a large battle between the Kaw and the Pawnee in 1812. [8] 

The Kaw tribe ceded ownership of this land in a treaty signed at the Shawnee Methodist Mission on January 14, 1846. [8] [9] 1854: Polistra and Canton [ edit ] 

The Kansas–Nebraska Act officially opened the territory to settlement by U.S. citizens in 1854. That fall, George S. Park founded the first Euro-American settlement within the borders of the current Manhattan. Park named it Polistra (some histories refer to it as Poliska or Poleska). [10] 

Later that same year, Samuel D. Houston and three other pioneers founded a neighboring community near the mouth of the Big Blue River that they named Canton. [11] Neither Canton nor Polistra ever grew to include anyone beyond their original founders. [8] Isaac Goodnow 1855: Free-Staters [ edit ] 

In March 1855, a group of New England Free-Staters traveled to Kansas Territory under the auspices of the New England Emigrant Aid Company to found a Free-State town. Led by Isaac Goodnow , the first members of the group (with the help of Samuel C. Pomeroy ) selected the location of the Polistra and Canton claims for the Aid Company's new settlement. Soon after the New Englanders arrived at the site, in April 1855, they agreed to join together with Canton and Polistra to make one settlement named Boston. [10] They were soon joined by dozens more New Englanders, including Goodnow's brother-in-law Joseph Denison . 

In June 1855, the paddle steamer Hartford , carrying 75 settlers from Ohio , ran aground in the Kansas River near the settlement. The Ohio settlers, who were members of the Cincinnati-Manhattan Company, had been headed twenty miles (32 km) further upstream to the headwaters of the Kansas River, the location today of Junction City . [12] After realizing they were stranded, the Hartford passengers accepted an invitation to join the new town, but insisted that it be renamed Manhattan, which was done on June 29, 1855. Manhattan was incorporated on May 30, 1857. [10] [13] Early events [ edit ] 

Early Manhattan settlers sometimes found themselves in conflict with Native Americans, and the town was threatened by pro- slavery Southerners. Manhattan was staunchly Free-State, and it elected the only two Free-State legislators to the first Territorial Legislature, commonly called the "Bogus Legislature." [8] However, nearby Fort Riley protected the settlement from the major violence visited upon other Free-State towns during the " Bleeding Kansas " era. This allowed the town to develop relatively quickly. On January 30, 1858, Territorial Governor James W. Denver signed an act naming Manhattan as county seat for Riley County . [8] Ten days later, on February 9, 1858, Governor Denver chartered a Methodist college in Manhattan, named Blue Mont Central College . [8] Blue Mont Central College building, built in 1859 

The young city received another boost when gold was discovered in the Rocky Mountains in 1859 and Fifty-Niners began to stream through Manhattan on their way to prospect in the mountains. Manhattan was one of the last significant settlements on the route west, and the village's merchants did a brisk business selling supplies to miners. Manhattan's first newspaper, The Kansas Express , began publishing on May 21, 1859. [8] 

In 1861, when the State of Kansas entered the Union, Isaac Goodnow, who had been a teacher in Rhode Island , began lobbying the legislature to convert Manhattan's Blue Mont Central College into the state university. The culmination of these efforts came on February 16, 1863, when the Kansas legislature established Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University ) in Manhattan. When the college began its first session on September 2, 1863, it was the first public college in Kansas, the nation's first land-grant institution created under the Morrill Act , and only the second public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally in the United States. [8] [14] [15] 

By the time the Kansas Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west through Manhattan in 1866, the 11-year-old settlement was permanently ensconced in the tallgrass prairie . Manhattan's population has grown every decade since its founding. 20th century [ edit ] 

The town was named an All-American City in 1952, becoming the first city in Kansas to win the award. [ citation needed ] 21st century [ edit ] 

In 2007 CNN and Money magazine rated Manhattan as one of the ten best places in America to retire young. [16] In 2011, Forbes rated Manhattan No. 1 for "Best Small Communities for a Business and Career." [17] Geography [ edit ] 

Manhattan's location is 39°11′25″N 96°35′13″W ﻿ / ﻿ 39.19028°N 96.58694°W ﻿ / 39.19028; -96.58694 (39.190142, −96.586818), [18] or about 50 miles (80 km) west of Topeka on the Kansas River . 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has an area of 18.79 square miles (48.67 km 2 ), of which, 18.76 square miles (48.59 km 2 ) is land and 0.03 square miles (0.08 km 2 ) is water. [2] Geographic features [ edit ] Flint Hills Discovery Center in Manhattan 

Manhattan is in Kansas' Flint Hills region, which consists of continuous rolling hills covered in tall grasses. However, the downtown area – Manhattan's original site – was built on a broad, flat floodplain at the junction of the Kansas and Big Blue rivers. Manhattan is largest town in the Flint Hills, and is home to the Flint Hills Discovery Center . 

Tuttle Creek Reservoir is 5 miles (8 km) north of Manhattan. The lake was formed when the Big Blue River was dammed for flood control in the 1960s, and it is now a state park that offers many recreational opportunities. South of the city is the Konza Prairie , a tallgrass prairie preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy and Kansas State University . Earthquakes [ edit ] Konza Prairie , 2005 

Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, but Manhattan is near the Nemaha Ridge , a long structure bounded by several faults, and which is still active. [19] In particular, the Humboldt Fault Zone lies just 12 miles (19 km) eastward of Tuttle Creek Reservoir. 

On April 24, 1867, the 1867 Manhattan earthquake struck Riley County. Measuring 5.1 on the Richter magnitude scale , the earthquake's epicenter was by Manhattan. It remains the strongest earthquake to originate in Kansas. The earthquake had an intensity of VII ( Very Strong ) on the Mercalli intensity scale , and was felt over roughly 193,051 square miles (500,000 km 2 ). It caused largely minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey . 

While Kansas is not seismically active, a strong earthquake could pose significant threats to the state. If an earthquake had occurred along the Nemaha Ridge prior to 2010, it could have destroyed the dam on Tuttle Creek Reservoir, releasing 300,000 feet (91,440 m) of water per second and flooding the nearby area, threatening roughly 13,000 people and 5,900 homes. A study in the 1980s found a moderate earthquake "between 5.7 to 6.6 would cause sand underneath the dam to liquefy into quicksand, causing the dam to spread out and the top to drop up to three feet." [20] To address this threat, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a project in July 2010 that replaced the sand with more than 350 concrete walls and equipped the dam with sensors. Alarms are connected to these sensors, which would alert nearby citizens to the earthquake. [20] Climate [ edit ] 

Manhattan lies in the transition between the humid continental ( Köppen Dfa ) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa ) zones, typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. [21] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 29.1 °F (−1.6 °C) in January to 79.9 °F (26.6 °C) in July. The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 58 days a year and 100 °F (38 °C) an average of 10 days. The minimum temperature falls to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on an average 5.3 days a year. [22] Extreme temperatures range from 116 °F (47 °C) on August 13, 1936 down to −35 °F (−37 °C) on February 12, 1899 . [22] 

On average, Manhattan receives 35.7 inches (907 mm) of precipitation annually, a majority of which occurs from May to August, and records 102 days of measurable precipitation. [22] Measurable snowfall occurs an average of 9.6 days per year with 6.1 days receiving at least 1.0 inch (2.5 cm). Snow depth of at least one inch occurs an average of 22 days a year. Typically, the average window for freezing temperatures is October 12 through April 21.

The state of Kansas falls within an area sometimes called Tornado Alley . The most recent tornado in Manhattan touched down at approximately 10:30 pm on June 11, 2008. Thirty-one homes and several businesses were destroyed by the EF4 tornado. Kansas State University 's campus incurred about $20 million in damage – a number of university buildings sustained significant damage and the tornado's winds destroyed the Wind Erosion Laboratory's garage. [23] No one was killed. [24] 

Previously, the most destructive tornado to hit Manhattan was on June 8, 1966. The 1966 tornado caused $5 million in damage and injured at least 65 people in Manhattan. [25] [26] Flooding [ edit ] 

Manhattan was built on a floodplain at the junction of the Kansas and Big Blue rivers, and it has faced recurring problems with flooding during times of heavy precipitation. The largest floods in the town's history were the 1903 and 1908 floods, the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993 .

[33] [34] Government [ edit ] Downtown Manhattan, 2005 Local [ edit ] 

Manhattan is governed under a council-manager system, with a five-member City Commission . Elections are nonpartisan and are held every other year, in odd-numbered years. Three City Commission positions are chosen in each election. The two highest vote recipients receive four-year terms, while the third highest vote recipient receives a two-year term. The highest vote winner in a general election is established to serve as mayor on the third year of a four-year term. The Mayor presides over Commission meetings, but has the same voting rights as other Commissioners and no veto power. 

As of 2015, Karen McCulloh serves as the city's mayor, while Usha Reddi, Linda Morse, Mike Dodson, and Wynn Butler make up the rest of the City Commission. [35] State [ edit ] 

Manhattan is located inside a number of state district boundaries. Most of Manhattan falls within two districts for the Kansas House of Representatives . Representative Tom Phillips (R) serves in District 67, which includes portions of south, west, and northern Riley County . Representative Sydney Carlin (D) represents District 66, which includes most of downtown Manhattan, and the northeastern portions of the city. Small portions of Manhattan extend into other districts to the south and north. 

Manhattan is the Kansas Senate District 22, and the state senator is Democrat Tom Hawk . Federal [ edit ] 

Manhattan is located in Kansas's 1st congressional district , which is represented by Republican Tim Huelskamp . Manhattan was moved from the 2nd District to the 1st District during redistricting in 2012. Manhattan had been placed originally in the 1st District when the state was subdivided in 1874. John Alexander Anderson of Manhattan served as the district's second Congressional representative, from 1879 to 1885. 

For federal elections, precise breakdowns are unavailable for only Manhattan, but a majority of voters in Riley County have never supported a Democratic candidate for president.

Culture in the city of Manhattan is largely defined by Kansas State University students. The city is normally full of activity while school is in session. Due to the city's vitality, the city was rated by CNN Money as one of the top ten places to retire young. [16] There are a number of cultural hot spots around the city. Aggieville – Aggieville is the hub of Manhattan's nightlife. Due to its large number of bars and shops, the district is frequented by college students and citizens alike. Aggieville's bars play host to numerous bands on a nightly basis. Nearby, the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the K-State campus is home to the university's permanent art collection and traveling art exhibits. Entry to the museum is free of charge.

The former Union Pacific passenger depot in Manhattan has been repurposed as an event space Rail [ edit ] 

Domestic passenger rail service to Manhattan began on August 20, 1866, on the Kansas Pacific Railroad line. [8] A mainline of the Union Pacific Railroad still passes through the city, but all passenger service to Manhattan was discontinued after the Amtrak takeover of passenger rail in 1971. 

The Rock Island Railroad also formerly served Manhattan as a stop on Rock Island's Kansas City–Colorado Springs Rocky Mountain Rocket service. [47] The Rock Island depot was located between Fifth and Sixth streets, along former El Paso Street (now Fort Riley Boulevard). The former railroad right-of-way was converted to Manhattan's southern arterial road as well as a rail-trail , linear park along Manhattan's west side. Intercity bus service [ edit ]

[48] Five twenty-passenger transit buses have been purchased for fixed-route service and the agency is awaiting operational funding from Kansas State University and the City. 

Historically, the city operated a streetcar system from 1909 to 1928. The trolley tracks were torn up and replaced by bus service in 1928, which was later also discontinued. Highways [ edit ] 

Manhattan is served by several highways: I-70 / US-40 runs about 9 miles (14 km) south of Manhattan. Three exits have a direct connection to Manhattan. Exit 313 – K-177 Exit 307 – McDowell Creek Road Exit 303 – K-18 US-24 runs through Manhattan. East on 24 is Wamego, west is Clay Center. US-24 comes in from Clay Center, runs north of the city, turns into a four-lane highway near Tuttle Creek State Park and travels south into the city as Tuttle Creek Boulevard until an intersection with East Poyntz Avenue, and then turns northeast towards Wamego. K-177 runs north from I-70 as Bill Snyder Highway until the Kansas River viaduct. A half-leaf interchange with K-18 (Tuttle Creek Blvd. and Ft.

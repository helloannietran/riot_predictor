Riots broke out in Trappes, a suburb (banlieue) of Paris, France on 19 July 2013 after the police arrested a man who assaulted a police officer who tried to check the identity of his wife wearing a Muslim veil on 18 July 2013.


== Background ==
France officially banned face covering in public places in April 2011. Although disputed by French Muslims, the law remains in effect. On 18 July a 21-year-old Muslim convert was asked by the police to remove her face-covering veil. Her husband, allegedly insulted, tried to choke the officer and was detained. The female was released on 20 July awaiting a court hearing.


== Riots ==
On 19 July hundreds of youth throwing rocks, reportedly mainly of North African ethnicity, attacked the local police station.
On 20 July 20 cars were burned in Trappes.

The name Bhagalpur is etymologically derived from Bhagdatpuram (meaning city of Good Luck), as it was called during the flourishing period of the Anga Kingdom . Bhagdatpuram , as per Hindu mythological texts, was the place where the gods ( devtas ) and demons ( asuras ) churned the ocean to procure elixir ( amrit ). It is believed that the serpent, Vasuki , offered to serve as the rope for the churning. An impression of the coil is faintly visible on Mount Mandara , a granite hill situated along the national highway between Bhagalpur and Dumka . It is believed that Panchjanya, the conch shell used in the Mahabharata was discovered here in the "Shankh Kund". The Puranas also refer to this hill. It is said that Vishnu covered the demon Madhu under the hill after defeating him to death. Kalidasa 's Kumarasambhava refers to foot marks of Vishnu on the slopes of Mount Mandara . The hill is replete with relics of bygone ages. Apart from inscriptions and statues, there are numerous rock cut sculptures depicting various images of Hindu Gods. The hill is equally revered by the Jains who believe that their 12th Tirthankara attained nirvana at the summit. The area around Mandara Hill is laced with a landscape of extraordinary splendour. The 800 feet high granite hill is a sight to see during daylight. It is a popular picnic spot for people living in the area. Vish-Hari Puja in Bhagalpur. 

References to Bhagalpur can be found in Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata where Bhagalpur has been described as the kingdom of Anga . Ancient cave sculptures from Emperor Ashoka 's reign, from 274 to 232 BC are found in the neighbourhood and at Sultangunj, 20 km west of Bhagalpur, a temple from the Gupta period still exists in Bhagalpur. The tomb of Suja, brother of Moghul emperor Aurangzeb , in the heart of the town is reminiscent of the town's association with the Mughal period . 

The ruins of ancient Vikramashila Mahavihara are located 44 km east of Bhagalpur. The royal university ranks next to Nalanda , and owes its origin to Dharmapala , the devout Pala king who called himself Paramasaugata (chief worshipper of the Buddha ) and was a great patron of Mahayana Buddhism . It was the medieval centre for the conservation and propagation of Buddhist education, established at the end of the 8th century. 

Bhagalpur formed a part of the ancient Sanskrit kingdom of Anga , said to be ruled by king Karna of Mahabharata who was well known for his charity . In later times it was included in the powerful Hindu kingdom of Magadha , or Behar, and in the 7th century it was an independent state, with the city of Champa as its capital. Afterwards it formed a part of the Mohammedan Kingdom of Gaur, West Bengal , and was subsequently subjugated by Akbar , who declared it to be a part of the Delhi empire. Bhagalpur passed to the East India Company by the grant of the emperor Shah Alam II in 1765. Bhagalpur was one of the most important trade centres in Bengal Presidency during the British rule in India. 

The communal violence that broke out in and around Bhagalpur in October 1989 continued for about two months, during which nearly 1200 lives were lost. Since then, it has emerged as one of the most economically and socially stable districts of Bihar. 

The Jain Temple at Nathnagar is an important pilgrimage centre for Jains. Budha Nath Temple is an ancient Shiva Temple on the bank of Ganges. Sultanganj (about 25 km West) is an important religious centre for Hindus from where holy water of Ganges is carried and offered at Deoghar . Bhagalpur also has the shrine of Shabaz Rahmat-ulla in maulanachak near Bhagalpur Railway Station and also Centre of Tablighi Jamat at Champanagar. Economy [ edit ] 

Bhagalpur has been associated with silk industry since hundreds of years and is hence known as "Silk City" making it famous all over India for its Tussar Silk Bhagalpuri Saree. 

However, due to the industrial revolution, large portion of silk business which is based on handloom get affected. Total revival of this industry need to be redesign in order to gain expertise of silk based handloom worker which nowadays is neglected from successive government. The thermal power plant at NTPC Kahalgaon in Kahalgaon falls under Bhagalpur district. The largest industrial belt of the district is Barari industrial Area, with Kahalgaon industrial Area being equally important. The Government of India has established a Hand-loom park . A food park has been established by private entrepreneurs. 

Bhagalpur hosts Domino's, Pizza Hut, The Laziz and Café 42 - a coffee house chain of CAD(B). Demography [ edit ] See also: List of cities in Bihar

It is the fourth largest city in Bihar in terms of urban population. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Bhagalpur has an average literacy rate of 81.16%, while the male literacy rate is 85.38% with women at 76.31%. Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary [ edit ] 

Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary [5] is famous for Gangetic dolphins , locally called as sonse. The Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary was established to protect the endangered Gangatic dolphins. This is the only sanctuary in Asia for the conservation of Gangetic dolphins. 

Once found easily in Ganga , today only 1500 Gangetic dolphins are left in the world. The half of them can be found at the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary , which is located in Bhagalpur district of Bihar in India. 

The sanctuary is a 50 km stretch of the river Ganga from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon . Gangetic dolphins are the major attraction of the sanctuary. This is a perfect place to watch dolphins. Vikramshila is one of the few dolphin tourism spots in India. Take the boat ride in the 50 km stretch of the Vikramshila sanctuary and you will definitely come across several Gangetic dolphins in the region. 

There are plenty of other wildlife too at the Vikramshila . Tourists will come across several species of freshwater turtles, waterfowl, otter and Gavialis gangeticus on their visit to the sanctuary. 

The best time to visit Vikramshila Sanctuary is June and October. You will get plenty of dolphin sightings during this period. Garuda (greater adjutant) [ edit ] Greater adjutant 

World's Second Largest Rescue and Rehabilitation Area for Garuda is Bhagalpur . In Indian mythology, Garuda is considered the vahana or carrier of the god Vishnu . The mythical Garuda is staging a comeback - only this time in reality. Four years after these endangered birds of the stork family started nesting and breeding in Bhagalpur district, their number has increased over sixfold - from 78 to over 500. [6] Worldwide its population is about 1200-1300. They live in only three places; one is Cambodia and other two are in India. In Cambodia, the garuda population is about 150, in Assam the garuda population is about 650, and in the Bhagalpur district (around Kadwa Diyara, a place nearby Naugachia) the garuda population is about 500. [7] 

Loss of nesting habitat and feeding sites through drainage, pollution and disturbance, together with hunting and egg collection, caused a massive dip in the population of the species. First spotted the Garuda birds nesting and breeding in 2007 on a silk cotton tree near a village in the Ganga -Diara area in Bhagalpur. In May 2006, 42 birds were seen by the Mandar Nature Club team for the first time. Prior to this, the species had never been seen in Bihar during its breeding period. 

The garuda, biologically known as greater adjutant ( Leptoptilos dubius ), is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List 2004 of threatened species and listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This huge stork has a naked pink head, a very thick yellow bill and a low-hanging neck pouch. The neck ruff is white. The bird looks like a vulture. Other than the pale grey edge on each wing, the rest of the greater adjutant's body is dark grey. Juveniles have a narrower bill, thicker down on the head and neck, and entirely dark wings. A Garuda bird measures 145–150 cm (about three feet) in length and four to five feet in height. [8] Main sights [ edit ] Vikrasmshila Mahavidyalaya [ edit ] The Main stupa at the centre 

Vikramashila Mahavidyalaya, 38 km from Bhagalpur ranks next to Nalanda and owes its origin to Dharmapala (770-810 AD), the devout Pala king who loved to call himself Paramasaugata (chief worshipper of the Buddha)and was a great patron of Mahayana Buddhism . Dharmapala was impressed by two things which prompted him to establish Vikramshila . Firstly, the rocky hillock anchored around the confluence of Kosi and Ganga at Vateshwarasthan was not only a scenic attraction but a popular tantric site as evident from the presence of a Kali temple (instead of Parvati’s) in front of Shiva temple, besides various other caves and rock cut sculptures dating back to the 6th or 7th century AD. Secondly, the place was associated with pilgrimage due to Uttarvahini Ganga which drew large crowds during Varsavardhana. Unlike Nalanda , sources of information on Vikramashila is confined to Tibetan texts and they make us believe that Dharmapala in his earlier birth was an accomplished acharya, Kampilya , who had attained siddhi or perfection in Mahayana mudra mysticism here and was determined to build a monastery one day. [9] Mandar Parvat (Hill) [ edit ] Sagar Manthan 

Mandar Parvat (Hill) is roughly 700 feet high. It is situated about 30 miles south of the Bhagalpur town in Bihar . There is an eastern railway line connecting Bhagalpur with Mandar Hill. Mandar Hill station is about three miles from Mandar Hill. There is also an all- weather road that connects Bhagalpur with Dumka . 

Amrit Manthana or Samudra manthan which suggests that the hill was used by the gods to churn the ocean to procure amrit. The serpent, Basukinaga offered to serve as the rope and has left behind an impression of the coil on the granite hill. It is believed that panchjanya, the conch shell used in Mahabharat War, was discovered here in the Sank kund. 

The puranas refer to various sacred places on the hill which is also believed to be the abode of Vishnu under the title of Madhusudana or the destroyer of a demon called Madhu who was killed by Vishnu and then covered by the Mandar hill. Kalidasa ’s Kumārasambhava refers to foot prints of Vishnu on the slopes of Mandar. Besides inscriptions and statues, there are numerous rock cut sculptures depicting various Brahmanical images. 

The hill is equally revered by the Jains who believe that their 12th Tirthankara attained nirvana here on the summit of the hill. 

At the salvation place on Mandar Hill, a grand Jain Mandar Hill Temple is erected. A pair of feet images (about 3000 years old) are installed there. There is a place where Lord Vasupujya attained Kevalgyan (supernatural knowledge) near the place of salvation. Three pairs of ancient feet images are installed here. Near the place of salvation, a beautiful cave temple is viewable with a 5-foot-tall standing idol. [10] Kuppa Ghat [ edit ] Kuppaghat Ashram 

The word 'Kuppa' means a tunnel or cave , and " Ghat " means place located on a river-bank. Accordingly, there is a cave at Kuppaghat which has been rendered famous and immortalised by Maharshi Mehi Paramhans , the legendary exponent of Santmat.Kuppa Ghat is a place located on the banks of the holy river Ganges at Bhagalpur, Bihar , India. Maharshi Mehi Ashram, Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur has, over the years, grown into a sacred pilgrimage for millions of followers of Santmat from India and abroad.

Maharshi Mehi practised surat shabd yoga or the Yoga of Inner Sound for several months here in this cave and later constructed his ashram also; several yogis or spiritual aspirants can still be seen practising the Yoga of Inner Light Sound in this dark cave completely insulated from the din bustle and brightness of the outside world. 

Maharshi Mehi Ashram blossomed under his dynamic leadership to become the national headquarters of Akhil Bharatiya Santmat-Satsang. It has an aesthetically laid out garden and orchard beautifully punctuated with sculptures, paintings and quotes having spiritual significance like a cottage showing Lord Rama visiting great female devotee Shabri and killing of Jatayu , the vulture, at the hands of the demon king Ravana . 

According to some unconfirmed accounts, Lord Gautama Buddha is also said to have lived in this cave in one of his previous births.

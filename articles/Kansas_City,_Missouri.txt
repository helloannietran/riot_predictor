Kansas City is the largest city in the U.S. state of Missouri and the sixth largest city in the Midwest . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had an estimated population of 475,378 in 2015, [6] making it the 36th largest city by population in the United States . It is the anchor city of the Kansas City metropolitan area , which straddles the Kansas – Missouri border. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a Missouri River port at its confluence with the Kansas River coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850 the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory . Confusion between the two ensued and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon thereafter. 

Sitting on Missouri's western border, with Downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the modern city encompasses some 319.03 square miles (826.3 km 2 ), making it the 23rd largest city by total area in the United States. Most of the city lies within Jackson County , but portions spill into Clay , Cass , and Platte counties. Along with Independence , it serves as one of the two county seats for Jackson County. Major suburbs include the Missouri cities of Independence and Lee's Summit and the Kansas cities of Overland Park , Olathe , and Kansas City . 

The city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the Country Club Plaza in the south. Kansas City is also known for its cuisine (including its distinctive style of barbecue ), its craft breweries and its major league sports teams.

Kansas City, Missouri was officially incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The territory straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers was considered a good place to build settlements. Exploration and settlement [ edit ] Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features Pony Express founder Alexander Majors , Westport/Kansas City founder John Calvin McCoy , and Mountain-man Jim Bridger who owned Chouteau's Store. 

The first documented European visitor to Kansas City was Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont , who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the Native American attack on Fort Détroit , he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about 90 miles (140 km) east near Brunswick, Missouri , where he illegally traded furs . 

To clear his name, he wrote Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony in 1713 followed in 1714 by The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River . In the documents, he describes the junction of the "Grande Riv[ière] des Cansez" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer Guillaume Delisle used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map. 

The Spanish took over the region in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their fur trade under Spanish license. The Chouteau family operated under Spanish license at St. Louis in the lower Missouri Valley as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where François Chouteau established Chouteau's Landing. 

After the 1804 Louisiana Purchase , Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of Mormons from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by mob violence in 1833 and their settlement remained vacant. [7] 

In 1833 John McCoy established West Port along the Santa Fe Trail , 3-mile (4.8-kilometre) away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of "Cansez." In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas. [8] 

By that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport and nearby Independence , had become critical points in America's westward expansion . Three major trails – the Santa Fe , California , and Oregon – all passed through Jackson County. 

On February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of 0.70 square miles (1.8 km 2 ) and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east. [9] American Civil War [ edit ] 

The Kansas City area was rife with animosity just prior to the U.S. Civil War . Kansas successfully petitioned the U.S. to enter the Union as a free state that did not allow slavery under the new doctrine of popular sovereignty . Missouri had many slaves. Slavery sympathizers crossed into Kansas to sway the state towards allowing slavery , at first by ballot box and then by bloodshed. A cannon and plaques mark the location of the Battle of Westport within modern day Loose Park. 

During the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the First Battle of Independence in August 1862 resulted in a Confederate victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The Second Battle of Independence , which occurred on October 21–22, 1864 as part of Sterling Price's Missouri expedition of 1864 , also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal Battle of Westport the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri. 

General Thomas Ewing , in response to a successful raid on nearby Lawrence, Kansas , led by William Quantrill , issued General Order No. 11 , forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties – including Jackson – except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing. Post-Civil War [ edit ] 

After the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly. The selection of the city over Leavenworth, Kansas , for the Hannibal St. Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by Octave Chanute , opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889 and the city limits to extend south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents. [10] Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898 

Kansas City, guided by architect George Kessler , became a forefront example of the City Beautiful movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks. [11] 

The relocation of Union Station to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the Liberty Memorial in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. Robert A. Long , president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the R.A. Long Building for the Long-Bell Lumber Company , his home, Corinthian Hall (now the Kansas City Museum ) and Longview Farm . 

Further spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative Country Club Plaza development by J.C. Nichols in 1925, as part of his Country Club District plan. Pendergast era [ edit ] 

At the start of the 20th century, political machines gained clout in the city, with the one led by Tom Pendergast dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the Kansas City City Hall and the Jackson County Courthouse. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness: 

Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize. [12] Post–World War II [ edit ] 

Kansas City's suburban development began with a streetcar system in the early decades of the 20th century. The city's first suburbs were in the neighborhoods of Pendleton Heights and Quality Hill. After World War II , many relatively affluent residents left for suburbs in Johnson County, Kansas , and eastern Jackson County, Missouri. Many also went north of the Missouri River , where Kansas City had incorporated areas between the 1940s and 1970s. 

In 1950, African Americans represented 12.2% of Kansas City's population. [10] The sprawling characteristics of the city and its environs today mainly took shape after 1960s race riots. The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. was a catalyst for the 1968 Kansas City riot . At this time, slums were forming in the inner city, and many who could afford to do so, left for the suburbs and outer edges of the city. The post-World War II idea of suburbs and the "American Dream" also contributed to the sprawl of the area. The city's population continued to grow, but the inner city declined. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites, [13] declined from 89.5% in 1930 to 54.9% in 2010. [10] 

In 1940, the city had about 400,000 residents; by 2000, the same area was home to only about 180,000. [ clarification needed ] From 1940 to 1960, the city more than doubled its physical size, while increasing its population by only about 75,000. By 1970, the city covered approximately 316 square miles (820 km 2 ), more than five times its size in 1940. 

The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse was a major disaster that occurred on July 17, 1981, killing 114 people and injuring more than 200 others during a tea dance. At the time, it was the deadliest structural collapse in US history. 21st century [ edit ] 

Power Light and the Sprint Center were constructed from 2005 to 2008, creating an entertainment district downtown. Both were built after a series of failed projects. 

The Kansas City Streetcar was the first rail transit line in the region in almost 60 years, beginning operations on May 6, 2016. It was constructed after a series of ballot failures over the preceding decades. The project proceeded after a legal challenge that saw the project election validated by the state supreme court. [14] Geography [ edit ] 

The city has a total area of 319.03 square miles (826.28 km 2 ), of which, 314.95 square miles (815.72 km 2 ) is land and 4.08 square miles (10.57 km 2 ) is water. [1] Bluffs overlook the rivers and river bottom areas. Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by glacier -carved limestone and bedrock cliffs. Kansas City is situated at the junction between the Dakota and Minnesota ice lobes during the maximum late Independence glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch . The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central city. This valley is an eastward continuation of the Turkey Creek Valley. It is the closest major city to the geographic center of the contiguous United States, or "Lower 48".

Kansas City, Missouri, comprises more than 240 [15] neighborhoods, some with histories as independent cities or as the sites of major events. Downtown is undergoing redevelopment with new condominiums, apartments, offices. The redeveloped Power Light District offers indoor/outdoor shopping, dining and entertainment including bars, restaurants, a grocery store, a roof-top pool club called The Jones, a performing arts center and the Sprint Center . Downtown/midtown has become an attractive residential option. Nearby neighborhoods include historic Westport, Ivanhoe , Hyde Park , Squire Park, the Crossroads Arts District , 18th and Vine Historic District , Pendleton Heights , Quality Hill , the West Bottoms and the River Market . Two other "near" downtown neighborhoods that are very popular and have unique appeal are the Country Club Plaza (or simply the "Plaza"), south Plaza and nearby Brookside. Architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of Kansas City Further information: List of fountains in the Kansas City metropolitan area and List of tallest buildings in Kansas City, Missouri Community Christian Church , designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and located adjacent to the Country Club Plaza . 

The Nelson-Atkins Museum opened its Euro-Style Bloch addition in 2007, and the Safdie-designed Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts opened in 2011. The Power and Light Building is influenced by the Art Deco style and sports a glowing sky beacon. The new world headquarters of H R Block is a 20-story all-glass oval bathed in a soft green light. The four industrial artworks atop the support towers of the Kansas City Convention Center ( Bartle Hall ) were once the subject of ridicule, but now define the night skyline near the new Sprint Center along with One Kansas City Place (Missouri's tallest office tower), the KCTV-Tower (Missouri's tallest freestanding structure) and the Liberty Memorial, a WWI memorial and museum that flaunts simulated flames and smoke billowing into the night skyline. Kansas City is home to significant national and international architecture firms including ACI Boland , BNIM , 360 Architecture , HNTB , Populous . Frank Lloyd Wright designed two private residences and Community Christian Church there. 

Kansas City hosts over 200 working fountains. Notable examples are located on the Country Club Plaza. Designs range from French-inspired traditional to modern. Highlights include the Black Marble H R Block fountain in front of Union Station, which features synchronized water jets; the Nichols Bronze Horses at the corner of Main and J,C, Nichols Parkway at the entrance to the Plaza Shopping District; and the fountain at Hallmark Cards World Headquarters in Crown Center . City Market [ edit ] The Town of Kansas Bridge offers a connection for foot and bike traffic from the Riverfront Heritage Trail (starting at Berkley Riverfront Park) to the River Market. 

Since its inception in 1857, City Market has been one of the largest and most enduring public farmers' markets in the American Midwest, linking growers and small businesses to the community. More than 30 full-time merchants operate year-round and offer specialty foods, fresh meats and seafood, restaurants and cafes, floral, home accessories and more. [16] The City Market is also home to the Arabia Steamboat Museum , which houses artifacts from a steamboat that sank near Kansas City in 1856. [16] Downtown [ edit ] Main article: Downtown Kansas City Downtown Kansas City and the Crossroads Arts District as viewed from Liberty Memorial (March 2016). 

Downtown Kansas City is an area of 2.9 square miles (7.5 km 2 ) bounded by the Missouri River to the north, 31st Street to the south, Troost Avenue to the East, and State Line Road to the west. Areas near Downtown Kansas City include the 39th Street District , which is known as Restaurant Row, [17] and features one of Kansas City's largest selections of independently owned restaurants and boutique shops. It is a center of literary and visual arts, and bohemian culture . Crown Center is the headquarters of Hallmark Cards and a major downtown shopping and entertainment complex. It is connected to Union Station by a series of covered walkways. The Country Club Plaza , or simply "the Plaza", is an upscale, outdoor shopping and entertainment district. It was the first suburban shopping district in the United States, [18] designed to accommodate shoppers arriving by automobile, [19] and is surrounded by apartments and condominiums, including a number of high rise buildings. The associated Country Club District to the south includes the Sunset Hill and Brookside neighborhoods, and is traversed by Ward Parkway , a landscaped boulevard known for its statuary, fountains and large, historic homes. Kansas City's Union Station is home to Science City , restaurants, shopping, theaters, and the city's Amtrak facility. The city's tallest buildings and characteristic skyline are roughly contained inside the downtown freeway loop (shaded in red). Downtown Kansas City itself is established by city ordinance to stretch from the Missouri River south to 31st Street (beyond the bottom of this map), and from State Line Rd. to Troost Ave. 

After years of neglect and seas of parking lots, Downtown Kansas City currently is undergoing a period of change with over $6 billion in development since 2000. Many residential properties recently have been or currently are under redevelopment in three surrounding warehouse loft districts and the Central Business District. The Power Light District , a new, nine-block entertainment district comprising numerous restaurants, bars, and retail shops, was developed by the Cordish Company of Baltimore , Maryland . Its first tenant opened on November 9, 2007. It is anchored by the Sprint Center, a 19,000-seat complex that has become a top draw for sports and musical entertainment. Elton John was the first performer to play at the Sprint Center.

Kansas City lies in the Midwestern United States , as well as near the geographic center of the country, at the confluence of the longest river in the country, the Missouri River , and the Kansas River (also known as the Kaw River). The city lies in the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone. [20] but is interchangeable with the humid continental climate due to roughly 104 air frosts on average per annum. [21] The city is part of USDA plant hardiness zones 5b and 6a. [22] Being located in the center of North America , far removed from a significant body of water, there is significant potential for extremes of hot and cold swings in temperature all year long. Unless otherwise stated, normal figures below are based on 1981–2010 data at Downtown Airport. The warmest month of the year is July, with a 24-hour average temperature of 81.0 °F (27.2 °C). The summer months are hot and unbearably humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico , and high temperatures surpass 100 °F (38 °C) on 5.6 days of the year, and 90 °F (32 °C) on 47 days. [23] [24] The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of 31.0 °F (−0.6 °C). Winters are cold, with 22 days where the high temperature is at or below 32.0 °F (0.0 °C) and 2.5 nights with a low at or below 0 °F (−18 °C). [23] The official record highest temperature is 113 °F (45 °C), set on August 14, 1936 at Downtown Airport, while the official record lowest is −23 °F (−31 °C), set on December 22 and 23, 1989. [23] Normal seasonal snowfall is 13.4 inches (34 cm) at Downtown Airport and 18.8 in (48 cm) at Kansas City International Airport. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 31 to April 4, while for measurable (0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall, it is November 27 to March 16 as measured at Kansas City International Airport. Precipitation, both in frequency and total accumulation, shows a marked uptick in late spring and summer. 

Kansas City is situated on the edge of the " Tornado Alley ", a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains in Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring. A few areas of the Kansas City metropolitan area have had some severe outbreaks of tornadoes at different points in the past, including the Ruskin Heights tornado in 1957 , [25] and the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence . The region can also fall victim to the sporadic ice storm during the winter months, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands of residents lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks. [26] Kansas City and its outlying areas are also subject to flooding, including the Great Floods of 1951 and 1993 .

Parks and boulevards [ edit ] J.C. Nichols Memorial Fountain , by Henri-Léon Gréber , in Mill Creek Park, adjacent to the Country Club Plaza. 

Kansas City has 132 miles (212 km) of boulevards and parkways, 214 urban parks, 49 ornamental fountains, 152 ball diamonds, 10 community centers, 105 tennis courts, 5 golf courses, 5 museums and attractions, 30 pools, and 47 park shelters. [67] [68] These amenities are found across the city. Much of the system, designed by George E. Kessler , was constructed from 1893 to 1915. 

Cliff Drive, in Kessler Park on the North Bluffs, is a designated State Scenic Byway. It extends 4.27 miles (6.87 km) from The Paseo and Independence Avenue through Indian Mound on Gladstone Boulevard at Belmont Boulevard, with many historical points and architectural landmarks. 

Ward Parkway , on the west side of the city near State Line Road , is lined by many of the city's largest and most elaborate homes. 

The Paseo is a major north–south parkway that runs 19 miles (31 km) through the center of the city beginning at Cliff Drive. It was modeled on the Paseo de la Reforma , a fashionable Mexico City boulevard. 

Swope Park is one of the nation's largest city parks, comprising 1,805 acres (730 ha), more than twice the size of New York City's Central Park . [69] It features a zoo , a woodland nature and wildlife rescue center, 2 golf courses, 2 lakes, an amphitheatre , a day-camp, and numerous picnic grounds. Hodge Park, in the Northland, covers 1,029 acres (416 ha) (1.61 sq. mi.). This park includes the 80-acre (320,000 m 2 ) Shoal Creek Living History Museum, a village of more than 20 historical buildings dating from 1807 to 1885. Riverfront Park, 955 acres (3.86 km 2 ) on the banks of the Missouri River on the north edge of downtown, holds annual Independence Day celebrations and other festivals. 

A program went underway to replace many of the fast-growing sweetgum trees with hardwood varieties. [70] Law and government [ edit ] City government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Kansas City and Alcohol laws of Missouri City Hall, Kansas City, Missouri. 

Kansas City is home to the largest municipal government in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of city manager has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the Kansas City City Council , which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019. 

Pendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was Harry S Truman , who became a Senator, Vice President and then President of the United States from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri , one of two federal district courts in Missouri. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri is located in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals , one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in Springfield ). 

The Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below: Office Officeholder Mayor (presides over Council) Sly James Councilman, District 1 Scott Wagner Councilwoman, District 1 Heather Hall Councilwoman, District 2 Teresa Loar Councilman, District 2 Dan Fowler Councilman, District 3 Quinton Lucas Councilman, District 3 Jermaine Reed Councilwoman, District 4 Katheryn Shields Councilwoman, District 4 Jolie Justus Councilman, District 5 Lee Barnes, Jr. Councilwoman, District 5 Alissia Canady Councilman, District 6 Scott Taylor Councilman, District 6 Kevin McManus City Manager Troy Schulte National political conventions [ edit ] 

Kansas City hosted the 1900 Democratic National Convention , the 1928 Republican National Convention and the 1976 Republican National Convention . The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in Presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City. Federal representation [ edit ] 

Kansas City is represented by three members of the United States House of Representatives : Missouri's 4th congressional district – the southern portion of Kansas City in Cass County; currently represented by Vicky Hartzler (Republican) Missouri's 5th congressional district – most of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence and portions of Cass County; currently represented by Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat) Missouri's 6th congressional district – all of Kansas City proper north of the Missouri River and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; currently represented by Sam Graves (Republican) Police respond to reports of a shooting near the intersection of 19th and Main in the Crossroads, Kansas City during the early hours of New Years Day, 2016 Crime [ edit ] 

Some of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the American Civil War . Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called Bleeding Kansas erupted, affecting border ruffians and Jayhawkers . During the war, Union troops burned all occupied dwellings in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the Kansas City Times turned outlaw Jesse James into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at Kearney, Missouri , and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue. 

In the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's "most wide open town". While this would give rise to Kansas City Jazz , it also led to the rise of the Kansas City mob (initially under Johnny Lazia ), as well as the arrival of organized crime . In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the River Quay entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss Nick Civella was recorded discussing gambling bets on Super Bowl IV (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the Stardust Casino , which was the basis for the film Casino (although the production minimizes the Kansas City connections). 

As of November 2012, Kansas City ranked 18th on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000. [71] Much of the city's violent crimes occur on the city's lower income East Side. Revitalizing the downtown and midtown areas has been fairly successful and now these areas have below average violent crime compared to major downtowns. [72] According to a 2007 analysis by The Kansas City Star and the University of Missouri-Kansas City , downtown experienced the largest drop in crime of any neighborhood in the city during the 2000s. [73] Education [ edit ] Main article: List of schools of Kansas City Colleges and universities [ edit ] 

Many universities, colleges, and seminaries are located in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including: University of Missouri–Kansas City − one of four schools in the University of Missouri system − serving more than 15,000 students Rockhurst University − Jesuit university founded in 1910 Kansas City Art Institute − four-year college of fine arts and design founded in 1885 Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences − medical and graduate school founded in 1916 Avila University − Catholic university of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Park University − private institution established in 1875; Park University Graduate School is located downtown Baker University − multiple branches of the School of Professional and Graduate Studies William Jewell College − private liberal arts institution founded in 1849 Metropolitan Community College (Kansas City) − a two-year college with multiple campuses located in the suburban metropolitan area Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary − Southern Baptist Convention Nazarene Theological Seminary − Church of the Nazarene Calvary Bible College and Theological Seminary Saint Paul School of Theology − Methodist Primary and secondary schools [ edit ] 

Kansas City is served by 16 school districts including 10 Public School Districts. There are also numerous private schools; Catholic schools in Kansas City are governed by the Diocese of Kansas City . 

The following Public School Districts serve Kansas City: [74] Kansas City, MO School District North Kansas City School District Center School District Hickman Mills C-1 School District Grandview C-4 School District Liberty School District Park Hill School District Platte County R-3 School District Raytown C-2 School District Lees Summit R-7 School District Blue Springs R-4 School District Independence School District Fort Osage R-1 School District Libraries and archives [ edit ] Linda Hall Library − internationally recognized independent library of science, engineering and technology, housing over one million volumes.

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Central Plains Region − one of 18 national records facilities, holding millions of archival records and microfilms for Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska in a new facility adjacent to Union Station, which was opened to the general public in 2008. Media [ edit ] The Kansas City Star ' s new printing plant that opened in June 2006. Main article: Media in Kansas City, Missouri Print media [ edit ] 

The Kansas City Star is the area's primary newspaper. William Rockhill Nelson and his partner, Samuel Morss, first published the evening paper on September 18, 1880. The Star competed heavily with the morning Kansas City Times before acquiring that publication in 1901. The "Times" name was discontinued in March 1990, when the morning paper was renamed the "Star." [75] 

Weekly newspapers include The Call [76] (which is focused toward Kansas City's African-American community), the Kansas City Business Journal , The Pitch , Ink , [77] and the bilingual publications Dos Mundos and KC Hispanic News . 

The city is served by two major faith-oriented newspapers: The Kansas City Metro Voice , serving the Christian community, and the Kansas City Jewish Chronicle , serving the Jewish community. It also the headquarters of the National Catholic Reporter , an independent Catholic newspaper. Broadcast media [ edit ] Landmark KCTV Tower on West 31st on Union Hill. 

The Kansas City media market (ranked 32nd by Arbitron [78] and 31st by Nielsen [79] ) includes 10 television stations, 30 FM and 21 AM radio stations. Kansas City broadcasting jobs have been a stepping stone for national television and radio personalities, notably Walter Cronkite and Mancow Muller . 

WDAF radio (610 AM, now at 106.5 FM; AM frequency now occupied by KCSP ) signed on in 1927 as an affiliate of the NBC Red Network , under the ownership of The Star. In 1949, the Star signed on WDAF-TV as an affiliate of the NBC television network. The Star sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an antitrust investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the Star ) over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations. KCMO radio (originally at 810 AM, now at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now KCTV ) in 1953. The respective owners of WHB (then at 710 AM, now at 810 AM) and KMBC radio (980 AM, now KMBZ ), Cook Paint and Varnish Company and the Midland Broadcasting Company, signed on WHB-TV/KMBC-TV as a time-share arrangement on VHF channel 9 in 1953; KMBC-TV took over channel 9 full-time in June 1954, after Cook Paint and Varnish purchased Midland Broadcasting's stations. 

The major broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Kansas City market (covering 32 counties in northwestern Missouri, with the exception of counties in the far northwestern part of the state that are within the adjacent Saint Joseph market, and northeastern Kansas); including WDAF-TV 4 ( Fox ), KCTV 5 ( CBS ), KMBC-TV 9 ( ABC ), KCPT 19 ( PBS ), KCWE 29 ( The CW ), KSHB-TV 41 ( NBC ) and KSMO-TV 62 ( MyNetworkTV ). Other television stations in the market include Saint Joseph-based KTAJ-TV 16 ( TBN ), Kansas City, Kansas-based TV25.tv (consisting of three locally owned stations throughout northeast Kansas, led by KCKS-LD 25, affiliated with several digital multicast networks), Lawrence, Kansas-based KMCI-TV 38 ( independent ), Spanish-language station KUKC-LP 48 ( Univision ), and KPXE-TV 50 ( Ion Television ). Film community [ edit ] Main article: Film in Kansas City 

Kansas City has been a locale for Hollywood film and television productions. Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the Calvin Company , a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to Hollywood careers, and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native Robert Altman directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to his first feature film, The Delinquents , in Kansas City using many local players. 

The 1983 television movie The Day After was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film Truman , starring Gary Sinise , was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include Article 99 , Mr. Mrs. Bridge , Kansas City , Paper Moon , In Cold Blood , Ninth Street , and Sometimes They Come Back (in and around nearby Liberty, Missouri ). More recently, a scene in the controversial film Brüno was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips. 

Today, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The Independent Filmmaker's Coalition is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is currently coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level. [80] Infrastructure [ edit ] Main articles: Kansas City Metropolitan Area § Transportation , and Kansas City Metropolitan Area 

Originally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the Santa Fe , Oregon and California trails. Later, with the construction of the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River , it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than any other U.S. city. Trans World Airlines (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub. Highways [ edit ] 

Missouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with Interstate 70 . Interstate 435 , which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the nation. The Kansas City metro area has more limited access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex , over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. The Sierra Club blames the extensive freeway network for excessive sprawl and the decline of central Kansas City. [81] On the other hand, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest logistics hubs. [82] Airports [ edit ] Kansas City International Airport 

Kansas City International Airport was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub. Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates 100 feet (30 m) from the street. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks , it required a costly overhaul to conform to the tighter security protocols. Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport was TWA's original headquarters and houses the Airline History Museum . It is still used for general aviation and airshows. Public transportation [ edit ] 

Like most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over 300 miles (480 km) of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down. KCATA- RideKC [ edit ] 

On December 28, 1965, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area. RideKC Bus and MAX [ edit ] A newly branded RideKC Bus. 

In July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX). MAX links the River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza. This corridor employs over 150,000 workers. [83] MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable "stations". MAX features (real-time GPS tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue. [84] The city is currently planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue. [85] KC Streetcar departing the Library stop heading north to the River Market. RideKC Streetcar [ edit ] 

On December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters. [86] The streetcar route runs along Main Street from the River Market to Union Station ; it debuted on May 6, 2016. [87] A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the Kansas City Streetcar Authority – operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., no fare is to be charged initially. [88] The city plans to add multiple extensions to the starter line. RideKC Bridj [ edit ] 

In 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus (all separate metro services) began merging into one coordinated transit service for the Kansas City region, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019. [89] Walkability [ edit ] 

A 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Kansas City as the 40th most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities. [90] As a whole, the city has a score of 34 out of 100. However, several of the more densely populated neighborhoods have much higher scores: Westport has a score of 91; the Downtown Loop has a score of 85; the Crossroads scored 85; and the Plaza scored 83. [91] Those ratings range from "A Walker's Paradise" to "Very Walkable." Sister cities [ edit ] 

Kansas City has 14 sister cities: [92] City Subdivision Country Date Seville Andalusia Spain 1967 Kurashiki Okayama Prefecture Japan 1972 Morelia Michoacán Mexico 1973 Freetown Western Area Sierra Leone 1974 Tainan Taiwan 1978 Xi'an Shaanxi People's Republic of China 1989 Guadalajara [93] Jalisco Mexico 1991 Hannover Lower Saxony Germany 1993 Port Harcourt Rivers State Nigeria 1993 Arusha Arusha Region Tanzania 1995 San Nicolás de los Garza Nuevo León Mexico 1997 Ramla Israel 1998 Metz Lorraine France 2004 Yan'an Shaanxi People's Republic of China See also [ edit ] Geography portal North America portal United States portal Missouri portal List of people from Kansas City, Missouri National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri Sites of interest of Kansas City

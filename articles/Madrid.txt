Madrid ( / m ə ˈ d r ɪ d / , Spanish: [maˈðɾið] , locally: [maˈðɾiθ, -ˈðɾi] ) is the capital of Spain , and the largest municipality of the Community of Madrid . The population of the city is almost 3.2 million [4] with a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. It is the third-largest city in the European Union , after London and Berlin , and its metropolitan area is the third-largest in the European Union after London and Paris . [5] [6] [7] [8] Located in south-western Europe, the city spans a total of 604.3 km 2 (233.3 sq mi). [9] 

The city is located on the Manzanares in the centre of both the country and the Community of Madrid (which comprises the city of Madrid, its conurbation and extended suburbs and villages); this community is bordered by the autonomous communities of Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha . As the capital city of Spain, seat of government , and residence of the Spanish monarch , Madrid is also the political, economic and cultural centre of Spain. [10] The current mayor is Manuela Carmena from Ahora Madrid . 

The Madrid urban agglomeration has the third-largest GDP [11] in the European Union and its influences in politics , education , entertainment , environment , media , fashion , science , culture , and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities . [12] [13] Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atlético de Madrid . Due to its economic output , high standard of living , and market size, Madrid is considered the major financial centre of Southern Europe [14] [15] and the Iberian Peninsula ; it hosts the head offices of the vast majority of major Spanish companies, such as Telefónica , Iberia , and Repsol . Madrid is the 17th most livable city in the world according to Monocle magazine, in its 2014 index. [16] [17] 

Madrid houses the headquarters of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), belonging to the United Nations Organization (UN), the SEGIB, the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). It also hosts major international regulators of Spanish: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Cervantes Institute and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fundéu BBVA). Madrid organizes fairs such as FITUR, [18] ARCO, [19] SIMO TCI [20] and the Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week . [21] 

While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets. Its landmarks include the Royal Palace of Madrid ; the Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park , founded in 1631; the 19th-century National Library building (founded in 1712) containing some of Spain's historical archives; a large number of national museums, [22] and the Golden Triangle of Art , located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three art museums: Prado Museum , the Reina Sofía Museum , a museum of modern art , and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum , which completes the shortcomings of the other two museums. [23] Cibeles Palace and Fountain have become one of the monument symbols of the city. [24] [25]

Etymology [ edit ] 

The first documented reference of the city originates in Andalusan times as the Arabic مجريط Majrīṭ (AFI [ maʤriːtˁ ]), which was retained in Medieval Spanish as Magerit ([ maʤeˈɾit ]). A wider number of theories have been formulated on possible earlier origins. 

According to legend, Madrid was founded by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tyrrhenius of Tuscany and Mantua ) and was named "Metragirta" or "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the original name of the city was "Ursaria" ("land of bears " in Latin ), because of the many bears that were to be found in the nearby forests, which, together with the strawberry tree (Spanish madroño ), have been the emblem of the city from the Middle Ages . [26] 

The most ancient recorded name of the city "Magerit" (for *Materit or *Mageterit ?) comes from the name of a fortress built on the Manzanares River in the 9th century AD , and means "Place of abundant water". [27] If the form is correct, it could be a Celtic place-name from ritu- 'ford' (Old Welsh rit , Welsh rhyd , Old Breton rit , Old Northern French roy ) and a first element, that is not clearly identified *mageto derivation of magos 'field, plain' (Old Irish mag 'field', Breton ma 'place'), or matu 'bear', that could explain the Latin translation Ursalia . [28] 

Nevertheless, it is also speculated that the origin of the current name of the city comes from the 2nd century BC. The Roman Empire established a settlement on the banks of the Manzanares river. The name of this first village was "Matrice" (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). Following the invasions carried out by the Germanic Sueves and Vandals , as well as the Sarmatic Alans during the 5th century AD, the Roman Empire no longer had the military presence required to defend its territories on the Iberian Peninsula, and as a consequence, these territories were soon occupied by the Vandals , who were in turn dispelled by the Visigoths , who then ruled Hispania in the name of the Roman emperor, also taking control of "Matrice". In the 8th century, the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula saw the name changed to "Mayrit", from the Arabic term ميرا Mayra [ citation needed ] (referencing water as a 'tree' or 'giver of life') and the Ibero-Roman suffix it that means 'place'. The modern "Madrid" evolved from the Mozarabic "Matrit", which is still in the Madrilenian gentilic . [29] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Madrid See also: Timeline of Madrid Middle Ages [ edit ] 

Although the site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, [30] [31] [32] and there are archeological remains of Carpetani settlement, [30] Roman villas , [33] a Visigoth basilica near the church of Santa María de la Almudena [26] [34] and three Visigoth necropoleis near Casa de Campo, Tetúan and Vicálvaro, [35] the first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. At the second half of the 9th century, [36] Emir Muhammad I of Córdoba built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares , [37] as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of León and Castile , with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of Córdoba , Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo . 

With the surrender of Toledo to Alfonso VI of León and Castile , the city was conquered by Christians in 1085, and it was integrated into the kingdom of Castile as a property of the Crown. [38] Christians replaced Muslims in the occupation of the center of the city, while Muslims and Jews settled in the suburbs. The city was thriving and was given the title of Villa , whose administrative district extended from the Jarama in the east to the river Guadarrama in the west. The government of the town was vested to the neighboring of Madrid since 1346, when king Alfonso XI of Castile implements the regiment, for which only the local oligarchy was taking sides in city decisions. [39] Since 1188, Madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile. In 1202, King Alfonso VIII of Castile gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council, [40] which was expanded in 1222 by Ferdinand III of Castile . 

In 1309, the Courts of Castile were joined in Madrid for the first time under Ferdinand IV of Castile , and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435. Since the unification of the kingdoms of Spain under a common Crown , the Courts were convened in Madrid more often. Modern Age [ edit ] 

During the revolt of the Comuneros , led by Juan de Padilla , Madrid joined the revolt against Emperor Charles V of Germany and I of Spain, but after defeat at the Battle of Villalar , Madrid was besieged and occupied by the royal troops. However, Charles I was generous to the town and gave it the titles of Coronada (Crowned) and Imperial . When Francis I of France was captured at the battle of Pavia , he was imprisoned in Madrid. And in the village is dated the Treaty of Madrid of 1526 (later denounced by the French) that resolved their situation. [41] View of Madrid from the west, facing the Puerta de la Vega (1562), by Anton van den Wyngaerde (called in Spain Antonio de las Viñas), commissioned by Philip II to collect views of his cities. Is seen in the foreground the banks of the Manzana, crossed by the predecessors to the Segovia Bridge (in the first third), and the Toledo Bridge (further south, right), which was built in a monumental form years later. The most prominent building in the north (left) is the Alcázar , which was part of the walled circuit and which would undergo several fires until the fatal one in 1734 that almost completely destroyed it and was replaced by the current Palacio Real . The following churches are seen in the village (from left to right: San Gil, San Juan, Santiago, San Salvador, Iglesia de San Miguel de los Octoes, San Nicolás, Santa María, San Justo, San Pedro, Capilla del Obispo, San Andrés and, outside the walls, San Francisco), that do not yet have even the profile of domes and chapiters by which they would be characterized in the following centuries. Outside the walls and on the river, there is a craft facility dedicated to the treatment of hides: the Pozacho Tanneries. The recent installation of the court imposed a regalía de aposento tax on private houses, which produced all kinds of resistance including, most notably, the construction of Casas a la malicia . [42] Plaza Mayor 

In general urban area grew the number of inhabitants, from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561, when the town had 30,000 inhabitants, Philip II of Spain moved his court from Valladolid to Madrid, installing it in the old castle . [43] Thanks to this, the city of Madrid became the political center of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606 ( Philip III of Spain 's government), in which the Court returned to Valladolid. This fact was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate. A famous expression indicated that identity: " Sólo Madrid es corte " (Madrid is the only court) which, conceptually, is also understood backwards: " Madrid es sólo corte " (Madrid is just court). 

During the reign of Philip III and Philip IV of Spain , Madrid saw a period of exceptional cultural brilliance, with the presence of geniuses such as Miguel de Cervantes , Diego Velázquez , Francisco de Quevedo and Lope de Vega . [44] Puerta de Alcalá 

The death of Charles II of Spain resulted in the War of the Spanish succession . The city supported the claim of Philip of Anjou as Philip V . While the city was occupied in 1706 by a Portuguese army, who proclaimed king the Archduke Charles of Austria under the name of Charles III, and again in 1710, remained loyal to Philip V. 

Philip V built the Royal Palace, the Royal Tapestry Factory and the main Royal Academies. [45] But the most important Bourbon was King Charles III of Spain , who was known as "the best mayor of Madrid". Charles III took upon himself the feat of transforming Madrid into a capital worthy of this category. He ordered the construction of sewers, street lighting, cemeteries outside the city, and many monuments ( Puerta de Alcalá , Cibeles Fountain), and cultural institutions (El Prado Museum, Royal Botanic Gardens , Royal Observatory, etc.). Despite being known as one of the greatest benefactors of Madrid, his beginnings were not entirely peaceful, as in 1766 he had to overcome the Esquilache Riots , a traditionalist revolt instigated by the nobility and clergy against his reformist intentions, demanding the repeal of the clothing decree ordering the shortening of the layers and the prohibition of the use of hats that hide the face, with the aim of reducing crime in the city. [46] 

The reign of Charles IV of Spain is not very meaningful to Madrid, except for the presence of Goya in the Court, who portrayed the popular and courtly life of the city. From the 19th century to present day [ edit ] Alcalá street 

On 27 October 1807, Charles IV and Napoleon I signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau , which allowed the passage of French troops through Spanish territory to join the Spanish troops and invade Portugal , which had refused to obey the order of international blockade against England . As this was happening, there was the Mutiny of Aranjuez (17 March 1808), by which the crown prince, Ferdinand VII , replaced his father as king. However, when Ferdinand VII returned to Madrid, the city was already occupied by Joachim-Napoléon Murat , so that both the king and his father were virtually prisoners of the French army. Napoleon, took advantage of the weakness of the Spanish Bourbons, forcing both, first the father then the son, to join him in Bayonne , where Ferdinand arrived on 20 April. 

In the absence of the two kings, the situation became more and more tense in the capital. On 2 May, a crowd began to gather at the Royal Palace . The crowd saw the French soldiers pulled out of the palace to the royal family members who were still in the palace. Immediately, the crowd launched an assault on the floats. The fight lasted hours and spread throughout Madrid. Subsequent repression was brutal. In the Paseo del Prado and in the fields of La Moncloa hundreds of patriots were shot due to Murat's order against "Spanish all carrying arms". Paintings such as The Third of May 1808 by Goya reflect the repression that ended the popular uprising on 2 May. [47] 

The Peninsular War against Napoleon, despite the last absolutist claims during the reign of Ferdinand VII , gave birth to a new country with a liberal and bourgeois character, open to influences coming from the rest of Europe. Madrid, the capital of Spain, experienced like no other city the changes caused by this opening and filled with theaters, cafes and newspapers. Madrid was frequently altered by revolutionary outbreaks and pronouncements, such as Vicálvaro 1854, led by General Leopoldo O'Donnell and initiating the progressive biennium. However, in the early 20th century Madrid looked more like a small town than a modern city. During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 950,000 inhabitants. New suburbs such as Las Ventas, Tetuán and El Carmen became the homes of the influx of workers, while Ensanche became a middle-class neighbourhood of Madrid.

The Spanish Constitution of 1931 was the first legislated on the state capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid. 

Madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities of Spain in the Civil War (1936–1939). The city was a stronghold of the Republicans from July 1936. Its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle in November 1936 and it was during the Civil War that Madrid became the first European city to be bombed by aeroplanes (Japan was the first to bomb civilians in world history, at Shanghai in 1932) specifically targeting civilians in the history of warfare . (See Siege of Madrid (1936–39) ). [49] 

During the economic boom in Spain from 1959 to 1973, the city experienced unprecedented, extraordinary development in terms of population and wealth, becoming the largest GDP city in Spain, and ranking third in Western Europe . The municipality was extended, annexing neighbouring council districts, to achieve the present extension of 607 km 2 (234.36 sq mi). The south of Madrid became very industrialized, and there were massive migrations from rural areas of Spain into the city. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of the new thriving middle class that appeared as result of the 1960s Spanish economic boom , while the south-eastern periphery became an extensive working-class settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform. [49] 

After the death of Franco and the start of the democratic regime, the 1978 constitution confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain . In 1979, the first municipal elections brought Madrid's first democratically elected mayor since the Second Republic. Madrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the foiled coup, 23-F , on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the leftist parties ( Enrique Tierno Galván , Juan Barranco Gallardo ), turning the city after more conservative positions ( Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún , José María Álvarez del Manzano , Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón and Ana Botella ). Benefiting from increasing prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, the capital city of Spain has consolidated its position as an important economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological centre on the European continent. [49] Madrid seen from Buenavista Hill Geography [ edit ] Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Madrid 

The Madrid region experiences a cold semi-arid climate [50] ( Köppen BSk ) [51] that boarders on a hot-summer Mediterranean climate Csa . With cool winters due to its altitude of 667 m (2,188 ft) above sea level and distance to the sea, including sporadic snowfalls and minimum temperatures sometimes below freezing. Summers are hot, in the warmest month – July -average temperatures during the day ranging from 32 to 33 °C (90 to 91 °F) depending on location. Summer temperatures occasionally climb over 35 °C (95 °F) during the city's heatwaves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, diurnal ranges are often significant during the summer. The highest recorded temperature was on 24 July 1995 with 42.2 °C (108.0 °F), and the lowest recorded temperature was on 16 January 1945 with −10.1 °C (13.8 °F). Although these records were registered at the airport, not at the city. [52] Precipitation is concentrated in the autumn and spring, and, together with Athens which has similar annual precipitation, is the driest capital in Europe. It is particularly sparse during the summer, taking the form of about two showers and/or thunderstorms a month.

Madrid derives almost 73.5 percent of its water supply from dams and reservoirs built on the Lozoya River , such as the El Atazar Dam , which was built in 1972 and inaugurated by Francisco Franco . [58] This water supply is managed by Canal de Isabel II, a public entity created in 1851. It is responsible for the supply, depurating waste water and the conservation of all the Comunidad de Madrid region natural water resources.

The population of Madrid generally increased from when the city became the national capital in the mid-16th century and has stabilised at about 3 million from the 1970s. 

From around 1970 until the mid-1990s, the city's population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown. Another reason might have been the slowdown in the rate of growth of the European economy. 

The demographic boom accelerated in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to immigration , in response to a surge in Spanish economic growth . According to census data, the population of the city grew by 271,856 between 2001 and 2005. 

As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world. In 2015, about 89.8% of the inhabitants were Spaniards, while people of other origins, including immigrants from Latin America, Europe, Asia, North Africa and West Africa, represented 11.2% of the population. 

The ten largest immigrant groups include: Ecuadorian : 104,184, Romanian : 52,875, Bolivian : 44,044, Colombian : 35,971, Peruvian : 35,083, Chinese : 34,666, Moroccan : 32,498, Dominican : 19,602, Brazilian : 14,583, and Paraguayan : 14,308. [59] There were 2,476 Japanese citizens registered with the Japanese embassy in Madrid in 1993. [60] There are also important communities of Filipinos , Equatorial Guineans , Bulgarians , Indians , Italians , Argentines , Senegalese and Poles . [59] 

A study made by Unión de comunidades islámicas de España demonstrated that there were about 250,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Community of Madrid as of 2012 [update] ( less than 4% of the total population of Madrid). The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 130,000 (52%) of them had Spanish nationality. [61] 

Districts that host the largest number of immigrants are Usera (28.37%), Centro (16.87%), Carabanchel (22.72%) and Tetuán (21.54%). Districts that host the smallest number are Fuencarral-El Pardo (9.27%), Retiro (9.64%) and Chamartín (11.74%). [ citation needed ] Many members of Madrid's Japanese community, particularly those with children, live in Majadahonda , Mirasierra , The Vaguada, and other areas in northwest Madrid, in proximity to the Japanese international school . Central Madrid attracted many Japanese company employees without children due to its proximity to places of employment. [60] 

The traditional religion in Madrid is the Roman Catholic . It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid . In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 57.1% of Madrid residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic . [62] Government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Madrid Cybele Palace : City Hall of Madrid and iconic monument of the city 

The City Council consists of 57 members, one of them being the mayor. The mayor presides over the RKO. 

The Plenary of the Council is the body of political representation of the citizens in the municipal government . Some of its attributions are: fiscal matters, the election and deposition of the mayor, the approval and modification of decrees and regulations, the approval of budgets, the agreements related to the limits and alteration of the municipal term, the services management, the participation in supramunicipal organizations, etc. [63] Nowadays, mayoral team consists of the mayor, the deputy mayor and 8 delegates; all of them form The Board of Delegates (the Municipal Executive Committee). [64] 

Madrid has tended to be a stronghold of the People's Party (PP, right-wing political party), which has controlled the city's mayoralty since 1989. In the 2007 regional and local elections, the People's Party obtained 34 seats, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE, left political party) obtained 18 and United Left (IU, left political party) obtained 5. In the 2015 elections, however, the PP was the party with the most votes but failed to gain a majority with Ahora Madrid the runner-up. Manuela Carmena, mayoral candidate for Ahora Madrid, was proclaimed mayor after a coalition pact between her party and the PSOE. Districts [ edit ] Main article: Districts of Madrid

Very little medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the Almendra central , including the San Nicolás and San Pedro el Viejo church towers, the church of St. Jerome , and the Bishop's Chapel . Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the Bridge of Segovia and the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales . Canalejas Square 

Many of the historic buildings of Madrid date from the Spanish Golden Age which coincided with the Habsburgs reign (1516–1700). [ citation needed ] Philip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. [66] These reforms were embodied in the Plaza Mayor , characterized by its symmetry and austerity, as well as the new Alcázar , which would become the second most impressive royal palace of the kingdom. [ citation needed ] The material used during the Habsburg era was mostly brick, and the humble façades contrast with the elaborate interiors. Notable buildings include the Prison of the Court , the Palace of the Councils , the Royal Convent of La Encarnación , and the Buen Retiro Palace . The Imperial College church model dome was imitated in all Spain. Pedro de Ribera introduced Churrigueresque architecture to Madrid; the Cuartel del Conde-Duque , the church of Montserrat , and the Bridge of Toledo are among the best examples. 

The reign of the Bourbons during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. Philip V tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanization of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, and other buildings such as St. Michael's Basilica and the Church of Santa Bárbara . King Charles III beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the Puerta de Alcalá , the Royal Observatory , the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande , the Casa de Correos in Puerta del Sol , the Real Casa de la Aduana and the General Hospital (now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music). The Paseo del Prado , surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The Duke of Berwick ordered the construction of the Liria Palace . The Gran Vía has styles ranging from Vienna Secession, Plateresque, Neo-Mudéjar, and Art Deco. 

During the early 19th century, the Peninsular War , the loss of viceroyalties in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development ( Royal Theatre , the National Library of Spain , the Palace of the Senate and the Congress). The Segovia Viaduct linked the Royal Alcázar to the southern part of town. 

From the mid 19th century until the Civil War, Madrid modernized and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. The expansion of Madrid developed under the Plan Castro , resulting in the neighborhoods of Salamanca , Argüelles and Chamberí . Arturo Soria conceived the linear city and built the first few kilometers of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The Gran Vía was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist. Antonio Palacios built a series of buildings inspired by the Viennese Secession , such as the Palace of Communication , the Fine Arts Circle of Madrid ( Círculo de Bellas Artes ) and the Río de La Plata Bank (Instituto Cervantes). Other notable buildings include the Bank of Spain , the neo-Gothic Almudena Cathedral , Atocha Station , and the Catalan art-nouveau Palace of Longoria . Las Ventas Bullring was built, as the Market of San Miguel (Cast-Iron style). Gate of Europe , built during the 1990s. 

The Civil War severely damaged the city. Subsequently, the old town and the Ensanche were destroyed, and numerous blocks of flats were built. Examples of post-war architecture include the Spanish Air Force headquarters, and the skyscrapers of Plaza de España , at the time (the 1950s) the highest in Europe. [ citation needed ] 

With the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers appeared in the late 20th century in the city, such as Torre Picasso , Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the Gate of Europe . During the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built, [ citation needed ] and together form the Cuatro Torres Business Area . Madrid-Barajas Airport Terminal 4 was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards. Terminal 4 is one of the world's largest terminal areas, [ citation needed ] and features glass panes and domes in the roof which allow natural light to pass through. Urban sculpture [ edit ] 

The streets of Madrid are a veritable museum of outdoor sculpture. The Museum of Outdoor Sculpture, located in the Paseo de la Castellana , is dedicated to abstract works, among which the Sirena Varada (Strander Mermaid) by Eduardo Chillida . 

Since the 18th century, the Paseo del Prado is decorated with an iconographic program with classical monumental fountains: the Fuente de la Alcachofa (Fountain of the Artichoke), the Cuatro Fuentes (Four Fountains), the Fuente de Neptuno (Fountain of Neptune ), the Fuente de Apolo (Fountain of Apollo ) and the Fuente de Cibeles (Fountain of Cybele , also known as Fountain of Cibeles), all designed by Ventura Rodríguez . 

The equestrian sculptures are particularly important, starting chronologically with two designed in the 17th century: the statue of Philip III, in the Plaza Mayor by Giambologna , and the statue of Philip IV, in the Plaza de Oriente (undoubtedly the most important statue of Madrid, projected by Velázquez and built by Pietro Tacca with scientific advice of Galileo Galilei ). 

Many areas of the Buen Retiro Park ( Parque del Retiro ) are really sculptural scenography: among them are The Fallen Angel by Ricardo Bellver , and the Monument to Alfonso XII , designed by José Grases Riera . 

In another vein are the neon advertising signs, some of which have acquired a historic range and are legally protected, such as Schweppes in Plaza de Callao or Tío Pepe in the Puerta del Sol , recently retired from its location for the restoration of the building.

Madrid is the European city with the highest number of trees and green surface per inhabitant and it has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are 16 m 2 (172 sq ft) of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the 10 m 2 (108 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization. Buen Retiro Park, gardens 

Buen Retiro Park ( Parque del Buen Retiro , or simply Parque del Retiro ), formerly the grounds of the palace built for Philip IV of Spain , is Madrid's most popular park and the largest park in central Madrid. Its area is more than 1.4 km 2 (0.5 sq mi) (350 acres) and it is located very close to the Puerta de Alcalá and not far from the Prado Museum . The park is entirely surrounded by the present-day city. Its lake in the middle once staged mini naval sham battles to amuse royalty; these days the more tranquil pastime of pleasure boating is popular. Inspired by London's Crystal Palace, the Palacio de Cristal can be found at the south-eastern end of the park. 

In the Buen Retiro Park is also the Forest of the Departed ( Bosque de los Ausentes ), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks . 

Atocha Railway Station ( Estación de Atocha ) is the city's first and most central station , and is also home to a 4,000-square-metre (43,056-square-foot) indoor garden, with more than 500 species of plant life and ponds with turtles and goldfish in. Casa de Campo , lake 

Casa de Campo is an enormous urban parkland to the west of the city, the largest in Spain and Madrid's main green lung. Its area is more than 1,700 hectares (6.6 sq mi). It is home to a fairground, the Madrid Zoo , an amusement park, the Parque de Atracciones de Madrid , and an outdoor municipal pool, to enjoy a bird's eye view of the park and city take a cable car trip above the tree tops. Casa de Campo's vegetation is one of its most important features. There are, in fact, three different ecosystems: oak, pine and river groves. The oak is the dominant tree species in the area and, although many of them are over 100 years old and reach a great height, they are also present in the form of chaparral and bushes. The pine-forest ecosystem boasts a large number of trees that have adapted perfectly to the light, dry conditions in the park. In addition, mushrooms often emerge after the first rains of autumn. Finally, the river groves, or riparian forests, are made up of various, mainly deciduous, species that grow in wetter areas. Examples include poplars, willows and alder trees. As regards fauna, this green space is home to approximately 133 vertebrate species. 

The Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid ( Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid ) is an 8-hectare botanical garden located in the Plaza de Murillo, next to the Prado Museum . It was an 18th-century creation by Carlos III and it was used as a base for the plant species being collected across the globe. There is an important research facility that started life as a base to develop herbal remedies and to house the species collected from the new-world trips, today it is dedicated to maintaining Europe's ecosystem. Campo del Moro Gardens 

The Royal Palace ( Palacio Real ) is surrounded by three green areas. In front of the palace, are the gardens of the Plaza de Oriente; to the north, the gardens of Sabatini and to the west up to the Manzanares River, the famous Campo del Moro. Campo del Moro gardens has a surface area of 20 hectares and is a scenic garden with an unusual layout filled with foliage and an air of English romanticism. The Sabatini Gardens have a formal Neoclassic style, consisting of well-trimmed hedges, in symmetric geometrical patterns, adorned with a pool, statues and fountains, with trees also planted in a symmetrical geometric shape. Plaza de Oriente can distinguish three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged around the central monument to Philip IV, in a grid, following the barroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each packed with box hedges, forms of cypress, yew and magnolia of small size, and flower plantations, temporary. These are bounded on either side by rows of statues paths, popularly known as the Gothic kings, and mark the dividing line between the main body of the plaza and the Cabo Noval Gardens at north, and the Lepanto Gardens at south. Mount of El Pardo 

Mount of El Pardo ( Monte de El Pardo ) is a mediterranean forest inside the city of Madrid. It is one of the best preserved Mediterranean Forests in Europe. The European Union has designated the Monte de El Pardo as a Special Protection Area for bird-life. This meadow, which has been used as hunting grounds by the royalty given the variety of game animals that have inhabited it since the Middle Ages, is home to 120 flora species and 200 vertebrae species. Rabbits, red partridges, wild cats, stags, deer and wild boars live among ilexes, cork oaks, ash trees, black poplars, oaks, junipers and rockroses. Monte del Pardo is part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares, spreading out from the Guadarrama Mountains range to the centre of Madrid, and protected by strong legal regulations. Just before crossing the city, the River Manzanares forms a valley composed by sandy elements and detritus from the mountain range. Mount of El Pardo and Soto de Viñuelas inside the city of Madrid 

Soto de Viñuelas , also known as Mount Viñuelas, is a meadow-oak forest north of the city of Madrid and east of the Monte de El Pardo. It is a fenced property of about 3,000 hectares, which includes important ecological values, landscape and art. Soto de Viñuelas is part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares, a nature reserve which is recognised as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO , where it has been classified as Area B, the legal instrument that allows agricultural land use. Soto de Viñuelas has also received the statement of Special Protection Area for Birds. Manzanares River 

El Capricho is a 14-hectare garden located in the area of Barajas district. It dates back to 1784. The art of landscaping in El Capricho is displayed in three different styles of classical gardenscapes: the "parterre" or French garden, English landscaping and the Italian giardino. 

Madrid Río (Madrid River) is a linear park that runs along the bank of the Manzanares River, in the middle of Madrid. It is an area of parkland 10 kilometres (6 miles) long and covers 649 hectares in six districts: Moncloa-Aravaca , Centro , Arganzuela , Latina , Carabanchel and Usera . It is a large area of environmental, sporting, leisure and cultural interest. Madrid Río provides a link with other green spaces in the city such as Casa de Campo and the Linear Park of the Manzanares River. The main landscaped area in Madrid Río is the Arganzuela Park, covering 23 hectares where pedestrian and cycling routes cover the whole park. The Madrid Río cycling network covers some 30 km (19 mi) and is linked to other bike routes. To the north, Madrid Rio connects to the Senda Real, the Green Ring for Cyclists and the E 7 (GR 10) trail, which goes as far as the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range. To the south, Madrid Río provides access to the Enrique Tierno Galván Park and the Linear Park of the Manzanares River, an extensive green zone running parallel to the river as far as Getafe. As well as the cycle routes there are 42 km (26 mi) of paths for walkers and runners. In the Salón de Pinos, a 6-kilometre long tree-lined promenade, there are circuits for aerobic and anaerobic exercise, while near the Puente de Praga bridge there is a tennis court and seven tennis courts. 

The theme park Faunia is a natural history museum and zoo combined, aimed at being fun and educational for children. It comprises eight eco-systems from tropical rain forests to polar regions , and contains over 1,500 animals, some of which roam freely within. Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Madrid Plaza Mayor (17th 18th centuries), original main marketplace of Madrid Headquarters of the Banco de España , Madrid 

After it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of consumption than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city’s own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as banking and publishing . 

A large industrial sector did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the service sector . 

Madrid is the 5th most important leading Center of Commerce in Europe (after London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world. [14] Economic history [ edit ] 

As the capital city of the Spanish Empire from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways. 

Industry started to develop on a large scale only in the 20th century, [67] but then grew rapidly, especially during the " Spanish miracle " period around the 1960s. The economy of the city was then centred on diverse manufacturing industries such as those related to motor vehicles , aircraft, chemicals, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals, processed food , printed materials, and leather goods. [68] Since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the city has continued to expand. Its economy is now among the most dynamic and diverse in the European Union . [69] Present-day economy [ edit ] 

As the national capital, Madrid concentrates activities directly connected with power (central and regional government, headquarters of Spanish companies, regional HQ of multinationals , financial institutions ) and with knowledge and technological innovation (research centres and universities). It is one of Europe's largest financial centres and the largest in Spain. [70] The city has 17 universities and over 30 research centres. [70] :52 It is the third metropolis in the EU by population, and the fourth by gross internal product.

They are considered masterpieces of Spanish Renaissance sculpture. St. Isidore Church from the Plaza Mayor 

St. Isidore Church was built between 1620 and 1664 by order of Empress Maria of Austria , daughter of Charles V of Germany and I of Spain , to become part of a school run by the Jesuits which still exists today. Its dome is the first example of a dome drawing on a wooden frame covered with plaster, which, given its lightness makes it easy to support the walls. It was the cathedral of Madrid between 1885 and 1993, which is the time it took to build the Almudena. The artwork inside were mostly burned during the Spanish Civil War , but it retained the tomb that holds the incorrupt body of Saint Isidore Laborer and the urn containing the ashes of his wife Maria Torribia . 

Royal Convent of La Encarnación is an Augustinian Recollect convent. The institution, which belonged ladies of the nobility, was founded by Queen Margaret of Austria , wife of Philip III of Spain , in the early 17th century.

The church's interior is a sumptuous work by the great Baroque architect Ventura Rodriguez . 

In the church are preserved shrines containing the blood of St. Januarius and St. Pantaleon , the second (according to tradition) liquefies every year on the saint's day on 27 July. 

San Antonio de los Alemanes (St. Anthony Church) is a pretty 17th-century church which was originally part of a Portuguese hospital. Subsequently, it was donated to the Germans living in the city. 

The interior of the church has been recently restored. It has some beautiful frescoes painted by Luca Giordano, Francisco Carreño and Francisco Rizi .

Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida is sometimes named the "Goya's Sistine Chapel". The chapel was built on orders of King Charles IV of Spain , who also commissioned the frescoes by Goya . These were completed over a six-month period in 1798. The frescoes portray miracles by Saint Anthony of Padua, including one which occurred in Lisbon, but which the painter has relocated to Madrid. On every 13 June, the chapel becomes the site of a lively pilgrimage in which young unwed women come to pray to St. Anthony and to ask for a partner. 

San Francisco el Grande Basilica was built in neoclassical style in the second half of the 18th century by Francesco Sabatini . It has the fifth largest diameter dome to Christianity.

State Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years. The current education system is called LOE ( Ley Orgánica de Educación ). [114] Universities [ edit ] 

Madrid is home to a large number of public and private universities . Some of them are among the oldest in the world, and many of them are the most prestigious universities in Spain. 

The "National Distance Education University", in Spanish Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED) has as its mission the public service of higher education through the modality of distance education. Facts and data about UNED: At more than 205,000 students (2015), UNED has the largest student population in Spain and is one of the largest universities in Europe. Since 1972, UNED has sought to translate into action the principle of equal opportunity in access to higher education through a methodology based on the principles of distance learning and focused on the needs of the student. UNED is the leader in the implementation of cutting edge technologies applied to learning, with the largest offer of virtual courses in Spain. Complutense University of Madrid , founded 1293 

The Complutense University of Madrid ( Universidad Complutense de Madrid ) is the second largest university in Spain after UNED Spanish open University and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has 10,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Nearly all academic staff are Spanish. It is located on two campuses, in the university quarter Ciudad Universitaria at Moncloa in Madrid, and in Somosaguas. [115] The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in Alcalá de Henares , old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back to 1293, when King Sancho IV of Castile built the General Schools of Alcalá, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. During the course of 1509–1510 five schools were already operative: Artes y Filosofía (Arts and Philosophy), Teología (Theology), Derecho Canónico (Canonical Laws), Letras (Liberal Arts) and Medicina (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of Isabel II , the University was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new University City (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King Alfonso XIII to this purpose. The Spanish Civil War turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage. In 1970 the Government reformed the High Education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. It was then when the new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcalá campus was reopened as the independent UAH, University of Alcalá , in 1977. Complutense also serves to the population of students who select Madrid as their residency during their study abroad period. Students from the United States for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion into the Spanish Language. The beautiful setting of the campus allows students living temporarily in Madrid to have access to all of the city's public features including Retiro Park, El Prado Museum, and much more. After studying at the University, students return home with a fluent sense of Spanish as well as culture and diversity. [116] School of Mines, Technical University of Madrid

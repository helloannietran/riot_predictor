Uttar Pradesh ( / ˈ ʊ t ər p r ə ˈ d ɛ ʃ / , Hindi : उत्तर प्रदेश literally "Northern Province" ), abbreviated as UP , is the most populous state in the Republic of India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world . It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces during British rule, and was renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950. Lucknow is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh. Ghaziabad , Kanpur , Gorakhpur , Allahabad , Raebareli , Moradabad , Bareilly , Aligarh , Sonbhadra , and Varanasi are known for their industrial importance in the state. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttarakhand , was carved out from the Himalayan hill region of Uttar Pradesh. The state in the northern region of the Indian subcontinent has over 200 million inhabitants. 

The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana , Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Madhya Pradesh to the south and touches the states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to the south east. It covers 243,290 square kilometres (93,933 sq mi), equal to 6.88% of the total area of India, and is the fourth largest Indian state by area . Hindi is the official and most widely spoken language in its 75 districts. Uttar Pradesh is the third largest Indian state by economy , with a GDP of ₹ 9,763 billion (US$150 billion). Agriculture and service industries are the largest parts of the state's economy. The service sector comprises travel and tourism , hotel industry , real estate , insurance and financial consultancies. 

Uttar Pradesh was home to powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna , join at Allahabad and then flow as the Ganges further east. The state has several historical, natural, and religious tourist destinations, such as, Agra , Varanasi , Piprahwa , Raebareli , Kaushambi , Kanpur , Ballia , Shravasti , Gorakhpur , Unnao , Chauri Chaura situated in Gorakhpur , Kushinagar , Lucknow , Jhansi , Allahabad , Budaun , Meerut , Mathura , Jaunpur , Muzaffarnagar and Shahjahanpur .

History [ edit ] Prehistory [ edit ] 

Modern human hunter-gatherers have been in Uttar Pradesh [4] [5] [6] since between around [7] 85 and 73 thousand years ago. There have also been pre-historical finds in Uttar Pradesh from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21–31 thousand years old [8] and Mesolithic / Microlithic hunter-gatherer 's settlement, near Pratapgarh , from around 10550–9550 BC. Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BC, and gradually developed between c. 4000 and 1500 BC beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa Culture to the Vedic period ; extending into the Iron Age . [9] [10] [11] Ancient and Classical period [ edit ] Rama portrayed as exile in the forest, accompanied by his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana 

The kingdom of Kosala , in the Mahajanapada era, was located within the regional boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh. [12] According to Hindu legend, the divine king Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya , the capital of Kosala. [13] Krishna , another divine king of Hindu legend, who plays a key role in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation ( Avatar ) of the Hindu god Vishnu , is said to have been born in the city of Mathura , in Uttar Pradesh. [12] The aftermath of the Mahabharata yuddh is believed to have taken place in the area between the Upper Doab and Delhi , (in what was Kuru Mahajanapada), during the reign of the Pandava king Yudhishthira . The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in North-west India, around 1000 BC. [12] 

Most of the invaders of south India passed through the Gangetic plains of what is today Uttar Pradesh. Control over this region was of vital importance to the power and stability of all of India's major empires, including the Maurya (320–200 BC), Kushan (AD 100–250), Gupta (350–600), and Gurjara-Pratihara (650–1036) empires. [14] Following the Huns invasions that broke the Gupta empire, the Ganges-Yamuna Doab saw the rise of Kannauj . [15] During the reign of Harshavardhana (590–647), the Kannauj empire reached its zenith. [15] It spanned from Punjab in the north and Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east and Odisha in the south. [12] It included parts of central India, north of the Narmada River and it encompassed the entire Indo-Gangetic plain . [16] Many communities in various parts of India claim descent from the migrants of Kannauj. [17] Soon after Harshavardhana's death, his empire disintegrated into many kingdoms, which were invaded and ruled by the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, which challenged Bengal's Pala Empire for control of the region. [16] Kannauj was several times invaded by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty from the 8th century to the 10th century. [18] [19] Medieval and Early Modern period [ edit ] 

In the 16th century, Babur , a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan ), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire , covering India , along with modern-day Afghanistan , Pakistan and Bangladesh [20] The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture). In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire. [17] Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi. [21] [22] In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri , took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal king Humanyun. [23] Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior . [24] After the death of Islam Shah Suri , his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal. He was bestowed the title of Hemchandra Vikramaditya (title of Vikramāditya adopted from vedic times) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Quila in Delhi on 7 October 1556. Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat , and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar 's rule. [25] Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri . [26] In the 18th century, after the fall of Mughal authority, the power vacuum was filled by the Maratha Empire , in the mid 18th century, the Maratha army invaded the Uttar Pradesh region, which resulted in Rohillas losing control of Rohillkhand to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar . The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18 December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia . In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War , when the British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, much of the region came under British suzerainty. [27] British India-era [ edit ] 

Starting from Bengal in the second half of the 18th century, a series of battles for north Indian lands finally gave the British East India Company accession over the state's territories. [28] Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the " North-Western Provinces " (of Agra). Although UP later became the fifth largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire. [29] Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad. [30] 

Due to dissatisfaction with British rule, a serious rebellion erupted in various parts of North India; Bengal regiment 's sepoy stationed at Meerut cantonment , Mangal Pandey , is widely credited as its starting point. [31] It came to be known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . After the revolt failed, the British attempted to divide the most rebellious regions by reorganising the administrative boundaries of the region, splitting the Delhi region from 'NWFP of Agra' and merging it with Punjab , while the Ajmer - Marwar region was merged with Rajputana and Oudh was incorporated into the state. The new state was called the 'North Western Provinces of Agra and Oudh', which in 1902 was renamed as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh . [32] It was commonly referred to as the United Provinces or its acronym UP. [33] [34] 

In 1920, the capital of the province was shifted from Allahabad to Lucknow . The high court continued to be at Allahabad, but a bench was established at Lucknow. Allahabad continues to be an important administrative base of today's Uttar Pradesh and has several administrative headquarters. [35] Uttar Pradesh continued to be central to Indian politics and was especially important in modern Indian history as a hotbed of the Indian independence movement . Uttar Pradesh hosted modern educational institutions such as the Benaras Hindu University , Aligarh Muslim University and the Darul Uloom Deoband . Nationally known figures such as Chandra Shekhar Azad were among the leaders of the movement in Uttar Pradesh, and Motilal Nehru , Jawaharlal Nehru , Madan Mohan Malaviya and Gobind Ballabh Pant were important national leaders of the Indian National Congress . The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was formed at the Lucknow session of the Congress on 11 April 1936, with the famous nationalist Swami Sahajanand Saraswati elected as its first President, [36] in order to address the longstanding grievances of the peasantry and mobilise them against the zamindari landlords attacks on their occupancy rights, thus sparking the Farmers movements in India. [37] During the Quit India Movement of 1942, Ballia district overthrew the colonial authority and installed an independent administration under Chittu Pandey . Ballia became known as "Baghi Ballia" (Rebel Ballia) for this significant role in India's independence movement. [38] Post-independence [ edit ] 

After India's independence, the United Provinces were renamed "Uttar Pradesh" in 1950, preserving UP as the acronym. [39] [40] The state has provided seven of India's prime ministers and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha . Despite its political influence, its poor record in economic development and administration, organised crime and corruption have kept it amongst India's backward states. The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste and communal violence. [41] In December, 1992 the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by radical activists, leading to widespread violence across India. [42] In 1999, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand . [43] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Uttar Pradesh A part of the Gangetic Plain 

Uttar Pradesh, with a total area of 243,290 square kilometres (93,935 sq mi), is India’s fourth largest state in terms of land area. It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, [44] but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains. [45] The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab , the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai . [46] The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. [47] It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps . [48] The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. [48] The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. [48] They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. [48] In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati , Sarayu , Betwa , and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism . [49] 

Cultivation is intensive. [50] The valley areas have fertile and rich soil. There is intensive cultivation on terraced hill slopes, but irrigation facilities are deficient. [51] The Siwalik Range which forms the southern foothills of the Himalayas , slopes down into a boulder bed called 'bhadhar'. [52] The transitional belt running along the entire length of the state is called the terai and bhabhar area. It has rich forests, cutting across it are innumerable streams which swell into raging torrents during the monsoon . [53] Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Uttar Pradesh Monsoon clouds over Lucknow 

Uttar Pradesh has a humid subtropical climate and experiences four seasons. [54] The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September. [55] Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0 °C and 50 °C in parts of the state. [56] The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. [55] The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650 mm in the southwest corner of the state to 1000 mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. [57] Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.

The rain in U.P. can vary from an annual average of 170 cm in hilly areas to 84 cm in Western U.P. [54] Given the concentration of most of this rainfall in the four months of the monsoon, excess rain can lead to floods and shortage to droughts. As such, these two phenomena, floods and droughts, commonly recur in the state. The climate of the Vindhya Range and plateau is subtropical with a mean annual rainfall between 1000 and 1200 mm, most of which comes during the monsoon. [55] Typical summer months are from March to June, with maximum temperatures ranging from 30 to 38 °C (86 to 100 °F). There is low relative humidity of around 20% and dust-laden winds blow throughout the season. In summers, hot winds called loo blow all across Uttar Pradesh.

The state has an abundance of natural resources. [69] In 2011 the recorded forest area in the state was 16,583 km 2 (6,403 sq mi) which is about 6.88% of the state's geographical area. [70] In spite of rapid deforestation and poaching of wildlife, a diverse flora and fauna continue to exist in the state. Several species of trees, large and small mammals , reptiles , and insects are found in the belt of temperate upper mountainous forests. Medicinal plants are found in the wild [71] and are also grown in plantations . The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands support cattle. Moist deciduous trees grow in the upper Gangetic plain, especially along its riverbanks. This plain supports a wide variety of plants and animals. The Ganges and its tributaries are the habitat of large and small reptiles, amphibians , fresh-water fish, and crabs. Scrubland trees such as the babool and animals such as the chinkara are found in the arid Vindhyas. [72] [73] 

Tropical dry deciduous forests are found in all parts of the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. [74] Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. [75] These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70 cm), a mean annual temperature of 25-27 °C and low humidity. 

Uttar Pradesh is known for its extensive avifauna . [76] The most common birds which are found in the state are doves , peafowl , junglefowl , black partridges , house sparrows , songbirds , blue jays , parakeets , quails , bulbuls , comb ducks , kingfishers , woodpeckers , snipes , and parrots. Bird sanctuaries in the state include Bakhira Sanctuary , National Chambal Sanctuary , Chandra Prabha Sanctuary , Hastinapur Sanctuary , Kaimoor Sanctuary , and Okhla Sanctuary . [ citation needed ] 

Other animals in the state include reptiles such as lizards , cobras , kraits , and gharials . Among the wide variety of fishes, the most common ones are mahaseer and trout . Some animal species in Uttar Pradesh have gone extinct in recent years, while others, like the lion from the Gangetic Plain and the rhinoceros from the Terai region , have become endangered . [77] Many species are vulnerable to poaching despite regulation by the government . [78] Divisions, districts and cities [ edit ] Main articles: Divisions of Uttar Pradesh and Districts of Uttar Pradesh See also: Western Uttar Pradesh , Eastern Uttar Pradesh , and Central Uttar Pradesh 

Uttar Pradesh is divided into 75 districts under these 18 divisions: [79] Saharanpur Moradabad Bareilly Lucknow Devipatan Basti Gorakhpur Meerut Aligarh Agra Kanpur Faizabad Azamgarh Jhansi Chitrakoot Allahabad Varanasi Mirzapur Divisions of Uttar Pradesh 

The following is a list of top six districts from state of Uttar Pradesh by rank in India.

Uttar Pradesh has a large population and a high population growth rate. From 1991 to 2001 its population increased by over 26%. [90] Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India , with 199,581,477 people on 1 March 2011. [91] The state contributes 16.16% of India's population. The population density is 828 people per square kilometre, making it one of the most densely populated states in the country. [1] 

The sex ratio in 2011, at 908 women to 1000 men, was lower than the national figure of 933. [1] The state's 2001–2011 decennial growth rate (including Uttrakhand) was 20.09%, higher than the national rate of 17.64%. [92] [93] Uttar Pradesh has a large number of people living below the poverty line . [94] Estimates released by the Planning Commission for the year 2009-10 revealed that Uttar Pradesh had 59 million people below the poverty line, the most for any state in India. [94] [95] 

As per 2011 census , Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, is home to the maximum number of Hindu and Muslim population. [96] The religion-wise percentage of the population in 2011 was Hindus 79.69, Muslims 19.25, Sikhs 0.30, Jains 0.11, Buddhists 0.10, Christians 0.18 and Others 0.30.

In 2001 the literacy rate in Uttar Pradesh stood at 56.27% overall, 67% for men and 43% for women. [100] 

Hindi and Urdu are the official languages of Uttar Pradesh. [3] Most people in Uttar Pradesh speak a dialect of Hindustani , which in its written forms is referred to as Urdu or Hindi depending on the script employed. [101] [102] People of Uttar Pradesh regard their language a very important part of their cultural identity. [103] Both Hindi and Urdu are spoken by both Hindus and Muslims. [104] 

A large number of other dialects exist. Five distinct dialect regions have been identified. The western part of the state, Rohilkhand and the upper Doab , is home to the speakers of Khari Boli (The dialect used for standard Hindi and standard Urdu). The lower Doab, which is referred as Braj Bhumi, or the land of Braj, is home to the speakers of Braj Bhasha . Further south, the Bundelkhand region people speaks Bundelkhandi . In central Uttar Pradesh, people speak the Awadhi dialect and Bhojpuri is spoken in the east, Bhojpuri speakers have a similar culture to those living in the neighbouring state of Bihar. Indian states are defined on the languages they speak, however, a large state like UP contains many linguistic and ethnic groups and therefore lacks a cohesive, statewide identity. [105] [106] Government and politics [ edit ] Main articles: Government of Uttar Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh Legislature See also: Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly election, 2012 Allahabad High Court is the fourth oldest high court of India 

Uttar Pradesh government is a democratically elected body in India with the Governor as its constitutional head. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh is appointed for a period of five years and appoints the Chief Minister and his council of ministers, who are vested with legislative powers. The governor remains a ceremonial head of the state, while the Chief Minister and his council are responsible for day-to-day government functions. Samajwadi Party occupies the current government headed by Vishal Tiwari(Kanpur) in Uttar Pradesh. Samajwadi Party came into existence in 1992 in Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of Mulayam Singh Yadav . The party formed the government in 1993, 2003 and 2012. The party believes in creating a socialist society and works on the principal of equality. 

Since Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament, it is often considered to be one of the most important states with respect to Indian politics. [107] The state contributes 80 seats to the Lok Sabha and 31 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament . [108] [109] [110] [111] Uttar Pradesh has been called India's under-achiever, because it has provided India with eight prime ministers while remaining a poor state. [112] The state's legislative body is divided into two significant parts: Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad [113] and Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha . [114] The state is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy , a feature the state shares with other Indian states. The Governor is the head of state and is appointed by the President of India . The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. In the 2012 election, the largest number of seats went to the Samajwadi Party with 224 seats. [115] At the local level, the state has a large number of village councils ( panchayats ), which are similar to those found in other Indian states. The administration in each district is headed by a District Magistrate who belongs to the Indian Administrative Service and is assisted by a number of officers belonging to state services. [116] 

Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government. [48] This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions. The Superintendent of Police (India) , an officer belonging to the Indian Police Service and assisted by the officers of the Uttar Pradesh Police Service, is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues in each district. [48] The Deputy Conservator of Forests , an officer belonging to the Indian Forest Service , also serves the government. [48] Sectoral development in the districts is looked after by the district head of each development department such as the Department of Public Works, Health, Education, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, etc. [116] 

The judiciary in the state consists of the Allahabad High Court in Allahabad , the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court , district courts namely the District court of Auraiya , the district court of Kanpur Dehat and district courts in each districts as Uttar Pradesh Judiciary , session courts in each district or Sessions Division, lower courts and judges at the taluka level. [117] The President of India appoints the chief justice of the High Court of the Uttar Pradesh judiciary on the advice of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of India as well as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. [48] Other judges are appointed by the chief justice of the high court of the judiciary of Uttar Pradesh on the advice of the Chief Justice. [117] [118] Subordinate Judicial Service is another vital part of the judiciary of Uttar Pradesh. The subordinate judiciary or the district courts are categorised into two divisions viz. Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services and Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service. [48] While the Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services comprises the Civil Judges (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistraes and civil judges (Senior Division)/Chief Judicial Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service comprises civil and sessions judges. The Subordinate judicial service of the judiciary at Uttar Pradesh is controlled by the District Judge. [48] The district court of Etawah and district court of Kanpur Dehat of Uttar Pradesh serves as the subordinate judicial service of the state. [119] Justice (retd.) Sanjay MIshra was appointed as the new Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh. [120] Crime [ edit ] 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau , Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of crimes among any state in India, but due to its high population, the actual per capita crime rate is low. [121] Because of this, the NCRB states that UP is the third safest state in the country to live in. The value of human development index in Uttar Pradesh has steadily increased over time. [122] [123] Uttar Pradesh has the second largest Civil police force with 107,840 members, accounting for 9.5% of the total civil police in the country.

A 1989 amendment to the act added Urdu as another native language of the state. [214] Linguistically, the state spreads across the Central, East-Central, and Eastern zones of the Indo-Aryan languages , the major native languages of the state being Awadhi , Bhojpuri , Bundeli , Braj Bhasha , Kannauji and the vernacular form of Khariboli . [215] Music and dance [ edit ] 

Uttar Pradesh has produced musicians, including Anup Jalota , Girija Devi , Gopal Shankar Misra , Hari Prasad Chaurasia , Kishan Maharaj , Vikash Maharaj [216] Naushad Ali , Ravi Shankar , Shubha Mudgal , Siddheshwari Devi , Talat Mehmood , and Ustad Bismillah Khan . The Ghazal singer Begum Akhtar was a native of Uttar Pradesh. The region's folk heritage includes songs called rasiya (especially popular in Braj ), which celebrate the divine love of Radha and Krishna . Other forms of music are kajari , sohar , qawwali , rasiya , thumri , birha, chaiti , and sawani . Traditional dance and musical styles are taught at the Bhatkhande Music Institute University in Lucknow, named after the musician Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande . [217] 

Kathak , a classical dance form, owes its origin to the state of Uttar Pradesh. [ citation needed ] The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where the rhythmic nimbleness of the feet is accompanied by the Tabla or Pakhawaj . [218] Four of the six schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana , Ajrara gharana , Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana , are situated in Uttar Pradesh.

[223] Cuisine [ edit ] Main article: Cuisine of Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradeshi thali with naan , sultani dal , raita , and shahi paneer Paan, (betel leaves) being served with silver foil 

A typical day-to-day traditional vegetarian meal of Uttar Pradesh, like any other North Indian thali , consists of roti (flatbread), chawal , dal , sabji , raita and papad . Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk ) with meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad , raita , salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer ). 

Many communities have their own particular style of cuisines, such as the Jains, Kayasths and Muslims. There are also certain sub-regional delicacies. Awadhi cuisine is world-famous for dishes such as kebab , biryani , keema and nihari . Sweets occupy an important place in the Hindu diet and are eaten at social ceremonies. People make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including khurchan, peda , gulabjamun , petha , makkhan malai, and chamcham . The chaat in Lucknow and Banarasi Paan is known across India for its flavour and ingredients. [224] 

Awadhi cuisine is from the city of Lucknow . The cuisine consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Awadh has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques , and the cuisine of Lucknow bears similarities to those of Central Asia , Kashmir , Punjab and Hyderabad ; and the city is known for Nawabi foods. [225] The bawarchis and rakabdars of Awadh gave birth to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their spread consisted of elaborate dishes like kebabs , kormas , biryani , kaliya, nahari-kulchas , zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis , and warqi parathas . The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton , paneer , and rich spices including cardamom and saffron . 

Mughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian subcontinent by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire . It represents the cooking styles used in North India , especially Uttar Pradesh. The cuisine is strongly influenced by the cuisine of Central Asia , and has in turn strongly similarities to the regional cuisines of Kashmir and the Punjab region. [225] The tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and is often associated with a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices. Dress [ edit ] 

The people of Uttar Pradesh dress in a variety of traditional and Western styles. [226] Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments – such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men – and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta - pyjama for men. [226] Men often sport head-gear like topi or pagri . [226] Sherwani is a more formal male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on festive occasions. European-style trousers and shirts are also common among the men. [226] Media [ edit ]

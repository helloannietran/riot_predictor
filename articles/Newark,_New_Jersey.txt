Newark ( / ˈ n uː . ər k / [23] or also locally / n ʊ ər k / [24] ) is the largest city (by population) in the U.S. state of New Jersey , and the county seat of Essex County . [25] [26] One of the nation's major air, shipping, and rail hubs, the city had a population of 277,140 in 2010, making it the nation's 67th most-populous municipality , after being ranked 63rd in the nation in 2000. [14] For 2015, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 281,944, an increase of 1.7% from the 2010 enumeration, [13] ranking the city the 70th largest in the nation. [27] Newark is the second largest city in the New York metropolitan area , located approximately 8 miles (13 km) west of lower Manhattan . 

Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony , Newark is one of the oldest European cities in the United States. Its location at the mouth of the Passaic River (where it flows into Newark Bay ), has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey . Today, Port Newark-Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast . In addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest. [28] [29] [30] 

Several leading companies have their headquarters in Newark, including Prudential , Panasonic Corporation of North America , Audible.com , and PSEG . A number of important higher education institutions are also located in the city, including the Newark campus of Rutgers University (which includes law and medical schools and the world-renowned Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies ); the New Jersey Institute of Technology ; and Seton Hall University's law school . The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey holds court in the city, as well. Local cultural venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center , Newark Symphony Hall , The Prudential Center , The Newark Museum , and the Bears Eagles Riverfront Stadium . 

Newark is divided into five political wards , and contains neighborhoods ranging in character from bustling urban districts to quiet suburban enclaves. Newark's Branch Brook Park is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000. [31] [32] [33] [34]

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Newark, New Jersey and Timeline of Newark, New Jersey 

Newark was originally founded in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony . It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas. [35] 

The name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent , England. This is on the grounds that the name was influenced by the original pastor, Abraham Pierson , who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire . [36] [37] [38] But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named "New Ark" for "New Ark of the Covenant [39] and some of the colonists saw it as "New-Work", the settlers' new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name "New Ark" are found in preserved letters written by historical figures such as David Ogden in his claim for compensation, and James McHenry , as late as 1787. [40] 

The city saw tremendous industrial and population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots . The city has experienced revitalization during the 1990s and early 21st century. [41] 

Newark was originally formed as a township on October 31, 1693, based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a Royal charter on April 27, 1713. During the American Revolutionary War there were several incidents when British troops made raids into the town. [42] 

Established on February 21, 1798, it was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature 's Township Act of 1798 , as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township ), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark's Vailsburg. [43] Geography and climate [ edit ] Geography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city had a total area of 26.107 square miles (67.617 km 2 ), including 24.187 square miles (62.644 km 2 ) of land and 1.920 square miles (4.973 km 2 ) of water (7.35%) was water. [1] [2] It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida . [44] The city's altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately 230 feet (70 m) above sea level in the western section of the city. [45] Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River , with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark's high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic. [46] 

Until the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was able to reclaim 68 acres (28 ha) of the marshland for the further expansion of Newark Airport , as well as the growth of the port lands. [30] 

Newark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung Mountains ), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey's Gateway Region , which is said to have received its name from Newark's nickname as the "Gateway City". [47] East Orange

Newark is New Jersey's largest and second-most racially diverse city (after neighboring Jersey City ). It is divided into five political wards , [48] which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards. [49] 

State law requires that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. [50] Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered , especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward. [51] [52] [53] Krueger Mansion in Newark's Central Ward 

Newark's Central Ward, formerly known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's history including the original squares Lincoln Park , Military Park and Washington Park . The Ward contains the University Heights , The Coast/Lincoln Park , Government Center , Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the subject of the 1968 novel Howard Street by Nathan Heard , is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue. 

In the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other white Catholic and Christian groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews , who were then replaced by Blacks . The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification , with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the largest health sciences university in the nation, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School . It is also home to three other universities – New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University – Newark , and Essex County College . The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library. [54] Home in Forest Hill 

The North Ward is surrounded by Branch Brook Park . Its neighborhoods include Broadway , Mount Pleasant , Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section. [55] Forest Hill contains the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered on state and national historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes . A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280 . The North Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse. [55] 

The West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg , Ivy Hill , West Side , Fairmount and Lower Roseville . It is home to the historic Fairmount Cemetery . The West Ward, once a predominately Irish-American, Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed primarily of Latinos, African Americans , and Caribbean Americans . [56] The West Ward has struggled in recent years with elevated rates of crime, particularly violent crime. [57] 

The South Ward comprises the Weequahic , Clinton Hill , Dayton , and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home to residents of predominately Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics . The South Ward is represented by Council Member John Sharpe James . The city's second-largest hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center , can be found in the South Ward, as can 17 public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, one police precinct, a mini precinct, and three fire houses. [58] 

The East Ward consists of much of Newark's Downtown commercial district, as well as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark's industry was located in the 19th century. Today, due to the enterprise of its immigrant population, the Ironbound (also known as "Down Neck" and "The Neck") [59] is a destination for shopping, dining, and nightlife. [60] A historically immigrant-dominated section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed "Little Portugal" and "Little Brazil" due to its heavily Portuguese and Brazilian population; Newark being home to one of the largest Portuguese speaking communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become home to various Latin Americans , African Americans, and commuters to Manhattan. Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and six elementary schools. The ward is largely composed of densely packed housing, primarily large apartment buildings and rowhouses .

Newark lies in the transition between a humid subtropical and humid continental climate ( Köppen Cfa/Dfa ), with cold, damp winters and hot, humid summers. The January daily mean is 31.6 °F (−0.2 °C), and although temperatures below 10 °F (−12 °C) are to be expected in most years, [63] sub-0 °F (−18 °C) readings are rare; conversely, some days may warm up to 50 °F (10 °C). The average seasonal snowfall is 29.5 inches (75 cm), though variations in weather patterns may bring sparse snowfall in some years and several major Nor'easters in others, with the heaviest 24-hour fall of 25.9 inches (66 cm) occurring on December 26, 1947. [64] Spring and autumn in the area are generally unstable yet mild. The July daily mean is 77.4 °F (25.2 °C), and highs exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 27 days per year, [64] not factoring in the oft-higher heat index . 

The city receives precipitation ranging from 2.9 to 4.8 inches (74 to 122 mm) per month, usually falling on 8 to 12 days per month. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −14 °F (−26 °C) on February 9, 1934 to 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 2011.

The city had a population of 277,140 as of the 2010 Census, [12] retaining its position as the largest city in the state and making it the nation's 67th most-populous municipality . [82] After reaching a peak of 442,337 residents counted in the 1930 Census , the city's population saw a decline of nearly 40% as residents moved to surrounding suburbs, with the increase in 2010 of 3,594 (+1.3%) from the 273,546 counted in the 2000 Census marking the second census in 70 years in which the city's population had grown from the previous enumeration. [9] [10] [11] [83] [84] 

" White flight " from Newark to the suburbs, which started in the 1940s accelerated in the 1960s. [85] The 1967 riots resulted in a significant population loss of the city's middle class, many of them Jewish , which continued from the 1970s through to the 1990s. [86] The city lost about 130,000 residents between 1960 and 1990. 

From the 1950s to 1967, white population shrank from 363,000 to 158,000, its black population grew from 70,000 to 220,000.

[88] The percentage of Latinos in Newark grew between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% to 33.8% while that of Blacks decreased from 58.2% to 52.4%. [89] [90] [91] [92] 

Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark, despite its revitalization in recent years. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished. [93] 

In advance of the 2000 United States Census , city officials made a push to get residents to respond and participate in the enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. [94] It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation. [95] 2010 Census [ edit ]

Though Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing. [106] The southern portion of the Ironbound , also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007.

On the national level, Newark leans strongly toward the Democratic Party. As of March 23, 2011, out of a 2010 Census population of 277,140 in Newark, there were 136,785 registered voters (66.3% of the 2010 population ages 18 and over of 206,253, vs. 77.7% in all of Essex County of the 589,051 ages 18 and up) of which, 68,393 (50.0% vs. 45.9% countywide) were registered as Democrats , 3,548 (2.6% vs. 9.9% countywide) were registered as Republicans , 64,812 (47.4% vs. 44.1% countywide) were registered as Unaffiliated and there were 30 voters registered to other parties. [236] 

In the 2012 presidential election , Democrat Barack Obama received 95.0% of the vote (78,352 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 4.7% (3,852 votes), and other candidates with 0.4% (298 votes), among the 82,030 ballots cast by the city's 145,059 registered voters for a turnout of 56.5%.

[243] Political corruption [ edit ] 

Newark has been marred with episodes of political corruption throughout the years. Five of the previous seven mayors of Newark have been indicted on criminal charges, including the three mayors before Cory Booker: Hugh Addonizio , Kenneth Gibson and Sharpe James . As reported by Newsweek : "... every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for crimes committed while in office". [244] 

Addonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the political machine of the era. During the 1967 riots , it was found that Addonizio and other city officials were taking kickbacks from city contractors. Addonizio was convicted of extortion and conspiracy in 1970, and was sentenced to ten years in federal prison. [245] 

His successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury. [246] 

Sharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy , mail fraud , and wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior. [247] Education [ edit ] Colleges and universities [ edit ] Campus of Rutgers University-Newark 

Newark is the home of the multiple institutions of higher education, including: a Berkeley College campus, [248] the main campus of Essex County College , [249] New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), [250] the Newark Campus of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (formerly University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ), [251] Rutgers University–Newark [252] and Seton Hall University School of Law . [253] Most of Newark's academic institutions are located in the city's University Heights district. The colleges and universities have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 50,000 students and faculty. [254] Public schools [ edit ] 

As of the 2006–2010 American Community Survey , 16.0% of Newark residents ages 25 and over had never attended high school and 15.9% didn't graduate, while 68.1% had at least graduated from high school, including the 12.3% who had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. The total school enrollment in Newark city was 75,025 in the 2006–2010 ACS, with pre-primary school enrollment of 10,560, elementary or high school enrollment of 46,691 and college enrollment of 17,774. [96] Newark Public Schools headquarters 

The Newark Public Schools , a state-operated school district, is the largest school system in New Jersey. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide, [255] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority . [256] [257] As of the 2013–14 school year, the district's 73 schools had an enrollment of 34,976 students and 3,057 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.4:1. [258] 

Science Park High School, which was the 69th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2010 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. Technology High School has a GreatSchools rating of 9/10 was ranked 165th in New Jersey Monthly's 2010 rankings. Newark high schools ranked in the bottom 10% of the New Jersey Monthly 2010 list include Central (274th), East Side (293rd), Newark Vocational (304th), Weequahic (310th), Barringer (311th), Malcolm X Shabazz (314th) and West Side (319th). [259] Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg donated a challenge grant of $100 million to the district in 2010, choosing Newark because he stated he believed in Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie's abilities. [260] 

Charter schools in Newark include the Robert Treat Academy Charter School , a National Blue Ribbon School drawing students from all over Newark. It remains one of the top performing K-8 schools in New Jersey based on standardized test scores. [261] University Heights Charter School is another charter school, serving children in grades K-5, recognized as a 2011 Epic Silver Gain School. [262] Gray Charter School , like Robert Treat, also won a Blue Ribbon Award. [263] Also, Newark Collegiate Academy (NCA) opened in August 2007 and currently serves 420 students in grades 9–12. It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other charter schools in the area. [264] Private schools [ edit ] 

The city hosts three high schools as part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark : the coeducational Christ The King Prep , founded in 2007, is part of the Cristo Rey Community ; Saint Benedict's Preparatory School is an all-boys Roman Catholic high school founded in 1868 and conducted by the Benedictine monks of Newark Abbey, whose campus has grown to encompass both sides of MLK Jr. Blvd. near Market Street and includes a dormitory for boarding students; and Saint Vincent Academy , is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and operated continuously since 1869. [265]

[266] University Heights Charter School, which opened in 2006, taught 614 students in grades PK-8 in 2014–2015. [267] Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] New York City and Jersey City skylines as seen from Newark Liberty International Airport 

Newark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and the northeastern United States . [268] Newark Liberty International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the New York region and the 15th-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic). [269] Newark Airport was the New York City area's first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on land reclaimed by the Port Authority. [30] 

Just east of the airport lies Port Newark, the fifteenth-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the East Coast of the United States . In 2003, the port moved over $100 billion in goods. [270] Early modes of transport [ edit ] Newark Trolley line on Market Street near the present-day courthouse 

The Morris Canal , stretching 102 miles (164 km) to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River , was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York metropolitan area . The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, the its right of way was converted into the Newark City Subway , now known as the Newark Light Rail . Many of the subway stations still portray the canal in its original state, in the form of mosaic works. [271] 

As the city became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys . These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse [272] The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden. [273] Roads and highways [ edit ] 

As of May 2010 [update] , the city had a total of 368.21 miles (592.58 km) of roadways, of which 318.77 miles (513.01 km) were maintained by the municipality, 17.61 miles (28.34 km) by Essex County and 22.66 miles (36.47 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 9.17 miles (14.76 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority . [274] Newark Light Rail 

Newark is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ), Interstate 280 , Interstate 78 , the Garden State Parkway , U.S. Route 1/9 , U.S. Route 22 , and Route 21 . Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the Pulaski Skyway , spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers , which was first constructed in 1938 and will be undergoing a $900 million renovation project. [275] 

Local streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue. [276] 

In a city extensively served by mass transit, 44.2% of Newark residents did not have a car as of the 2000 Census, ranked second in the U.S. to New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile among cities with more than 250,000 people. [277] Public transportation [ edit ] Newark Penn Station 

Newark Penn Station , situated just east of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield . Built in the bed of the Morris Canal , the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport , connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark . Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark. [278] 

Newark is served by NJ Transit bus routes 1 , 5 , 11 , 13 , 21 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 34 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 59 , 62 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 78 , 79 , 90 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 96 , 99 , 107 , and 108 . Bus route 308 is an express bus route to Six Flags Great Adventure from Newark Penn Station while 319 is an express service to Atlantic City . [279] 

The go bus 25 and go bus 28 are bus rapid transit lines through the city to Irvington , Bloomfield and Newark Liberty International Airport. [280] [281] Healthcare [ edit ] 

Newark is home to five hospitals. University Hospital , an independent institution that is a teaching hospital of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences , [282] has been the busiest Level I trauma center in the state. [283] Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is the largest hospital in the city and is a part of Barnabas Health , the state's largest system of hospital and health care facilities. [284] Beth Israel is also one of the oldest hospitals in the city, dating back to 1901. This 669-bed regional facility is also home to the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Catholic Health East operates Saint Michael's Medical Center. Columbus Hospital LTACH is a longterm acute care hospital designed to focus on patients with serious and complex medical conditions that require intense specialized treatment for an extended period of recovery time. [285] Hospitals which have been closed in recent years include the Saint James Hospital, Mount Carmel Guild Hospital and the United Hospitals Medical Center. [286] [287] [288] Public safety [ edit ] Emergency Medical Services [ edit ] 

University Hospital EMS (UH-EMS) operates the EMS system for the city. The department operates a fleet of six BLS units staffed with two EMTs 24/7, four 12-hour power trucks, and five ALS units staffed with two paramedics (one of which is stationed at Newark Airport and covers the airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth). With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck in the country. The EMS system is the busiest system per unit in the nation. On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20-25 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar, with one of the two NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one flight nurse and a flight medic around the clock. The EMS system in Newark handles upwards of 125,000 requests for service annually. [289] Fire department [ edit ] Former Engine 8 firehouse in the Ironbound neighborhood

The Newark Police Department is a city-operated law enforcement agency. As of January 2014, the force had 1,006 officers in its ranks. [291] 

The Essex County Sheriff's Office, New Jersey Transit Police Department (headquartered in Penn Plaza East ) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department are also within their jurisdiction in the city, as are the New Jersey State Police . In April 2014, it was announced that the State Police would play a more prominent role in patrolling the streets of the city under the "TIDE-TAG" program. [292] The Essex County College Police Department, [293] New Jersey Institute of Technology Police Department [294] and Rutgers University Police Department [295] patrol their respective college campuses in the city. Crime [ edit ] 

In 1996, Money magazine ranked Newark "The Most Dangerous City in the Nation." [296] By 2007, the city recorded a total of 99 homicides for the year, representing a significant drop from the record of 161 murders set in 1981. [297] [298] [299] [300] The number of murders in 2008 dropped to 65, a decline of 30% from the previous year and the lowest in the city since 2002 when there were also 65 murders. [301] 

In 2010, Newark recorded 90 homicides. [302] March 2010 was the first calendar month since 1966 in which the city did not record a homicide. [303] Overall, there was a 6% increase in crime numbers over the previous year, including a rise in carjackings for the third straight year, with the 337 incidents raising concerns that the city was returning to its status as the "car theft capital of the world". [304] Along with the increase in crime, the Newark Police Department increased its recovery of illegally owned guns in 2011 to 696, up from 278 in 2010. [305] The Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded 94 homicides in 2011 and 95 in 2012. [306] In 2012 CNNMoney ranked Newark as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States based on numbers by FBI Crime in the United States 2011 report. [307] The city had 10 murders in 10 days during the period ending September 6, 2013, a statistic largely attributed to the reduction of the police force. [308] [309] In 2013 Newark recorded 111 homicides, the first year ending in triple digits in seven years [310] and the highest tally since 1990, accounting for 27% of all murders statewide. [311] In 2014, the total number of homicides in Newark was 93, [312] while Essex County as a whole had 117 murders. [313] The Star-Ledger reported that there were 105 homicides in the city in 2015.

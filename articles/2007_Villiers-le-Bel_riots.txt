Riots in the Val-d'Oise department in France began 26 November 2007, following the deaths of two teenagers (Moushin S., 15, and Larami S., 16), [1] [2] whose motorcycle collided with a police vehicle . [3] The circumstances recalled those that precipitated the 2005 unrest , which began in Clichy-sous-Bois when two teenagers lost their lives as they evaded arrest while hiding in an electrical substation . Contents 1 Motorcycle accident 2 Riots and government response 3 Aftermath 4 See also 5 References 

Motorcycle accident [ edit ] 

The unrest began when the minibike , on which the youths were riding, collided with a police vehicle . [3] The families of the youths allege that police rammed the motorcycle and left the two teenagers for dead. [4] The police deny this, saying that the motorcycle was stolen [5] [6] and was an unregistered vehicle not valid for street use, travelling at high speed, and that the youths were not wearing any protective headgear - an account, according to French newspaper reports, confirmed by two eyewitnesses . [2] A police investigation indicated that the motorcycle was in third (top) gear and that the police car was not going over 40 km/h (25 mph). [2] Riots and government response [ edit ] 

Immediately after the incident, a hostile crowd [2] formed around the spot of the road accident . Divisional Commissioner Jean-François Illy, in charge of Sarcelles area, had his car burned and was hit with iron bars as he was trying to defuse the situation, and was hospitalised with a fractured nose and ribs . [2] However, the scene of the accident was kept untouched by the crowd . [7] [8] 

Over 130 policemen were injured during night-time riots and violent clashes, which began in Villiers-le-Bel in the Val-d'Oise department. [3] [9] Over 70 cars and buildings were burned , including a library , two schools , a police station , and several shops . [3] According to Interior Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie , several police officers were hit by shotgun pellets. One officer received a serious shoulder wound when a firearm projectile pierced his body armour and another lost an eye. [9] [1] including six seriously wounded officers "who notably were struck in the face and close to the eyes." [1] One police officer said that thirty officers had been hit by shotgun pellets, and one hit by a "bullet used to kill large game." He likened the situation to a " guerrilla war ". [10] 

At least ten cars were burned and a fire broke out at a library in Reynerie, a suburb of the southern city of Toulouse . [11] Eight rioters were arrested by the police on the night of 27 November. [12] [13] 

On 28 November, President Nicolas Sarkozy , who was in China during the events, met Prime Minister François Fillon , Interior Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie , and Justice Minister Rachida Dati for a security briefing. [14] The authorities decided not to give detailed account of the riots; [15] however, they announced that 39 people were arrested the night before. 

On 29 November, French suburbs stayed relatively calm after 1,000 riot police were deployed. There was no report of injuries. [16] Aftermath [ edit ] 

An investigation has been opened against the rioters. Another has been opened concerning the accident. [17] On 18 February 2008, 33 people were arrested, suspected of being rioters.

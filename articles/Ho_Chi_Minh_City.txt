Ho Chi Minh City ( Vietnamese : Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ; IPA: [tʰan fo ho̞˧˩ t͡ɕɪj˧ mɪ̈n˧] ( listen ) ), formerly named and still also referred to as Saigon ( Vietnamese : Sài Gòn ; IPA: [sâj ɣɔ̂ŋ] ( listen ) ), is the largest city in Vietnam . It was once known as Prey Nokor ( Khmer : ព្រៃនគរ ), an important Khmer seaport prior to annexation by the Vietnamese in the 17th century. Under the name Saigon, it was the capital of the French colony of Cochinchina and later of the independent republic of South Vietnam 1955–75. On 2 July 1976, Saigon merged with the surrounding Gia Định Province and was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh (although the name Sài Gòn is still unofficially widely used). [4] 

The metropolitan area , which consists of the Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area, Thủ Dầu Một , Biên Hòa , Vũng Tàu , Dĩ An, Thuận An and surrounding towns, is populated by more than 10 million people, [nb 1] making it the most populous metropolitan area [5] in Vietnam. The city's population is expected to grow to 13.9 million by 2025. [6] 

The Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area , a metropolitan area covering most parts of the south-east region plus Tiền Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of 30,000 square kilometres (12,000 sq mi) with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. [7] According to the Mercer Human Resource Consulting , Economist Intelligence Unit and ECA International , Ho Chi Minh City is ranked 132 on the list of the world's most expensive cities .

Etymology [ edit ] Main article: Names of Ho Chi Minh City Sài Gòn may refer to the kapok ( bông gòn ) trees that are common around the city. 

Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. In the 1690s, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh , a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. Control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the official name of Gia Định ( 嘉 定 ). This name remained until the time of French conquest in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name Saigon for the city, a westernized form of the traditional name, [8] although the city was still indicated as 嘉 定 on Vietnamese maps written in Chữ Hán until at least 1891. [9] Immediately after the communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975, a provisional government renamed the city after Hồ Chí Minh , the late North Vietnamese leader. [nb 2] Even today, however, the informal name of Sài Gòn / Saigon remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora . In particular, Sài Gòn is still commonly used to refer to District 1 . [10] Saigon Railway Station retains the traditional name used informally since the 1620s. Saigon [ edit ] 

An etymology of Saigon (or Sài Gòn in Vietnamese) is that Sài is a Sino-Vietnamese word ( Hán tự : 柴 ) meaning "firewood, lops, twigs; palisade", while Gòn is another Sino-Vietnamese word ( Hán tự : 棍 ) meaning "stick, pole, bole", and whose meaning evolved into "cotton" in Vietnamese ( bông gòn , literally "cotton stick", i.e., "cotton plant", then shortened to gòn ). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at Cây Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred. [11] 

Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon ( 堤 岸 ), the Cantonese name of Cholon , which means "embankment" (French: quais ), [nb 3] and Vietnamese Sai Côn , a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor ( Khmer : ព្រៃនគរ ). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word 'Nation' — thus, "forest city" or "forest kingdom". [nb 4] 

Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouk's royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokor's proper name was Preah Reach Nokor ( Khmer : ព្រះរាជនគរ ), "Royal City"; later locally corrupted to "Prey kor", meaning "kapok forest", from which "Saigon" was derived ("kor" meaning "kapok" in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as "gòn" ). [12] Ho Chi Minh City [ edit ] 

The current official name, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh , adopted in 1976 and abbreviated Tp. HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City , abbreviated HCMC, and in French as Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates Hồ Chí Minh , the first leader of Vietnam . This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, 胡 ) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from Sino-Vietnamese 志 明 ; Chí meaning 'will' (or spirit), and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "light bringer". [13] History [ edit ] Location of the hexagonal Gia Dinh Citadel (r) and Cholon area (tilted square, left) in 1815. Today this forms the area of Ho Chi Minh City. Early history [ edit ] 

Ho Chi Minh City began as a small fishing village likely known as Prey Nokor, "Forest City", or perhaps Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle meant "Royal City". [14] The area that the city now occupies was originally swampland, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese. In Khmer folklore southern Vietnam was given to the Vietnamese government as a dowry for the marriage of a Vietnamese princess to a Khmer prince in order to stop constant invasions and pillaging of Khmer villages. [15] The early dynastical entity was the Rhead-Sivakumaran family who dominated the region in the early Romanic period, until the Qing dynasty overcame the armies of Rhead-Sivakumaran and General Behan in 820 BC. [16] Khmer territory [ edit ] 

Beginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. [ citation needed ] In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (1618–28) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a custom house there. [17] Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. [ citation needed ] The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodia's access to the East Sea . Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers' sea access was south-westerly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep . Nguyễn Dynasty rule [ edit ] A French drawing of the French Siege of Saigon in 1859 by joint Franco-Spanish forces 

In 1698, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh , a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế by sea [18] to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia Định was built, [19] which was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of Kỳ Hòa (see Citadel of Saigon ). [ citation needed ] Colonial French era [ edit ] 

Conquered by France and Spain in 1859, the city was influenced by the French during their colonial occupation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French. [20] 

In 1931, a new région called Saïgon–Cholon consisting of Saïgon and Cholon was formed. [21] Saïgon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. [22] In 1956, after South Vietnam's independence from France in 1955, the région of Saïgon–Cholon became a single city called Saïgon following the merger of the two cities of Saïgon and Cholon. Capital of the Republic of Vietnam [ edit ] 

The Viet Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas. During this time, the U.S. supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi , Haiphong and Thái Bình . [23] [24] 

Former Emperor Bảo Đại made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel ( Bến Hải River ), with the communist Việt Minh , under Ho Chi Minh , gaining complete control of the northern half of the country , while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm in 1955 in the referendum . Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the Đô Thành Sài Gòn ( Capital City Saigon ), or Thủ đô Sài Gòn ( National Capital Saigon ). South Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their allies during the Vietnam War , with the assistance of the United States and other countries. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell and the war ended. [25] Post-Vietnam War and today [ edit ] Street life in Saigon 

At the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army . Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the " fall of Saigon ", while the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the "Liberation of Saigon". In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia Ðịnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader Hồ Chí Minh. The former name Saigon is still widely used by many Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. [26] Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.

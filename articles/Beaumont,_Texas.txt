Beaumont ( / ˈ b oʊ m ɒ n t / BOH -mont ) is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County , Texas in the United States , [4] within the Beaumont– Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area . Located in Southeast Texas on the Neches River about 90 mi (140 km) east of Houston , Beaumont city had a population of 118,296 at the time of the 2010 census , making it the twenty-fourth-most populous city in the state of Texas . 

Beaumont's early history was centered on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, Joseph Eloi Broussard opened the first rice mill in the state, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also organized an irrigation authority to support rice culture. A big change occurred in 1901 with the Spindletop gusher, which demonstrated the potential of the huge oil field. The area transformed into one of the major petro-chemical refining areas in the country. Along with Port Arthur and Orange , Beaumont forms the Golden Triangle , a major industrial area on the Gulf Coast . 

Beaumont is home of Lamar University , a national Carnegie Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and post graduates. Over the years, several corporations have called Beaumont home, including Gulf States Utilities which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its absorption by Entergy Corporation in 1993. GSU's Edison Plaza headquarters is still the tallest building in Beaumont (as of 2011). With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some continue.

History [ edit ] 

In 1824 Noah and Nancy Tevis settled on the west bank of the Neches River and organized a farm. Soon after that, a small community grew up around the farm, which was named Tevis Bluff or Neches River Settlement . [5] In 1835 the land of Tevis together with nearby community of Santa Anna (in total, 50 acres (20 ha)) was purchased by Northerners Henry Millard (1796?–1844) of New York, [6] Joseph Pulsifer (1805–1861) of Massachusetts, [7] and Thomas Byers Huling (1804–1865) of Pennsylvania . [8] They began planning a town to be laid out on this land. [5] Their partnership, J.P. Pulsifer and Company, controlled the first 50 acres (200,000 m 2 ) upon which the town was founded. [7] This town was named Beaumont, after Jefferson Beaumont, the brother-in-law of Henry Millard . They added more property for a total of 200 acres. 

Beaumont became a town on 16 December 1838. Beaumont's first mayor was Alexander Calder . [9] From the town's founding in 1835, business activities included real estate, transportation, and retail sales. Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center, as it was a port. Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. 

The Beaumont Rice Mill, founded in 1892 by Joseph Eloi Broussard , was the first commercial rice mill in Texas. In addition, Broussard established an authority for an irrigation system to support rice culture. This helped stimulate the expansion of rice cultivation from 1500 acres in 1892 to 400,000 acres in 23 counties by his death in 1956. [10] Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the Civil War . 

The rise of Beaumont's mill economy drew many new residents to the city, many of them immigrants. The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation. [11] By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems. [12] Lucas Gusher, Spindletop 

Oil was discovered at nearby Spindletop on 10 January 1901. Spindletop became the first major oil field and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP. 

William Casper Tyrrell , nicknamed "Captain W.C.", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the Texas Oil Boom . An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at Spindletop , and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the Tyrrell Historical Library . [13] 

When the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during World War II , tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000. [14] Ultimately the white mob rioted for three days, destroying major black neighborhoods and killing five persons. No one was prosecuted for the deaths. The riot in Beaumont was one of several in 1943 which centered in the defense industry, including Los Angeles , [15] Detroit , [16] Chicago [17] and Mobile, Alabama [18] as well as other cities across the country. The wartime social disruption was similar to war time riots which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following World War I . 

In the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. Although Beaumont's city center is located 85 highway miles from the Houston city center and 60 air miles from city limit boundary to city limit boundary, the city is now considered part of the widespread Houston metropolitan area. As was typical with other cities, postwar highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of population in search of new housing. There has been some renewal in Beaumont downtown and people have rediscovered the river. 

In 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents, eliminating the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents. 

In 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike . A mandatory evacuation was ordered for residents, lasting about two weeks. Geography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 85.9 square miles (222 km 2 ), of which 85.0 square miles (220 km 2 ) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km 2 ) (1.07%) is water. 

Beaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about 30 miles (48 km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico , one hour drive east of Houston , and just south of the dense pine forests of East Texas . The city is bordered on the east by the Neches River and to the north by Pine Island Bayou . Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the downtown area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Beaumont, Texas 

The city of Beaumont, Texas is within the humid subtropical climate zone. [19] This city is located within the Piney Woods, which cover the eastern region of Texas, as well as adjacent Louisiana . [20] This region of Texas receives the most rainfall in the state, with more than 48 inches (1,200 mm) annually. This is due to the warm gulf waters that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates. Hurricanes also strike the region, the most disastrous of which was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 , as well as Hurricane Ike in 2008. Hurricane Ike was the largest and most damaging hurricane to hit Beaumont to date, striking 13 September 2008. Causing $32 billion in damage, it is the third-costliest hurricane in United States history. [21] The humidity of the region greatly amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer. The winters are moderated by warm gulf currents. Wintry precipitation is unusual, but does occur. A recent snow event was 24 December 2004, the first such since 1989. However, more recently, Beaumont and the surrounding areas received a light snow on 11 December 2008, with up to 4 inches (100 mm) in the west end. Beaumont and the surrounding areas received a trace to half an inch of light snow on 4 December 2009. These are the earliest measurable snowfalls at the airport since the late 19th century. Although in unofficial records, Beaumont received as much as 30 inches (760 mm) of snow on 14 February and 15 during the blizzard of 1895 that impacted the gulf coast with unusual cold weather. Unofficially the temperature reported a drop to a low of 4 °F (−16 °C) after the storm. The area suffered a severe ice storm in January 1997. On 18 August 2009, a tornado hit the west end of Beaumont, and caused damage to several local businesses and cars. Injuries were minimal. [22] 

The Beaumont-Port Arthur region has historically been cited as one of the most polluted urban areas in the United States due to various energy industries and chemical plants in the area. Even so, as of July, 2014, the Beaumont-Port Arthur region was not under any Environmental Protection Agency non-attainment restrictions; however, counties in the Greater Houston area, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex , and El Paso were. [23] As of October, 2014, the Beaumont-Port Arthur area was not under any Texas Commission on Environmental Quality attainment compliance deadlines. [24] Regardless, according to an article published in 2007 focusing on Beaumont's neighbor to the south, Port Arthur , pollution was believed to have caused some general area residents to become sick and has generated debates throughout the media.

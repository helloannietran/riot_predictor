Zagreb ( Croatian pronunciation: [zǎːɡreb] ; [6] names in other languages ) is the capital and the largest city of the Republic of Croatia . It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level . In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. [7] The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. 

Zagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia , in today's Ščitarjevo . The name "Zagreb" is mentioned for the first time in 1094 at the founding of the Zagreb diocese of Kaptol , and Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242, whereas the origin of the name still remains a mystery in spite of several theories. In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor , Janko Kamauf , and in 1945 it was made the capital of Croatia when the demographic boom and the urban sprawl made the city as it is known today. 

Zagreb has a special status in the Republic of Croatia 's administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County ), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts , most of them being at low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south. 

The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government , administrative bodies and almost all government ministries . Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe , the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy , high quality of living, museums , sporting and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector .

History [ edit ] Manduševac fountain Zagreb in 1686 Main articles: History of Zagreb and Timeline of Zagreb 

The oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia , now Šćitarjevo , which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. [8] The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centers: the smaller, eastern Kaptol , inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral , and the larger, western Gradec , inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Zagreb were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jelačić , who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jelačić Square in his honour. [9] During the period of former Yugoslavia , Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital. [10] Etymology [ edit ] 

The name Zagreb appears to have been first recorded in 1134 in a document relating to the establishment of the Zagreb bishopric around 1094, although the origins of the name Zagreb are less clear. The Croatian word "zagrabiti" translates approximately to "to scoop", which forms the basis of some legends . One Croat legend says that a Croat ban ( viceroy ) was leading his thirsty soldiers across a deserted region. He drove his sabre into the ground in frustration and water poured out, so he ordered his soldiers to dig for water. The idea of digging or unearthing is supported by scientists [ who? ] who suggest that the settlement was established beyond a water-filled hole or graba and that the name derives from this. [11] 

According to another old legend, a city governor was thirsty and ordered a girl named Manda to take water from Manduševac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jelačić Square), using the sentence: "Zagrabi, Mando!" which means, Scoop it up, Manda! . [12] 

Some sources suggest that the name derives from the term 'za breg(om)' or 'beyond the hill'. The hill may well have been the river bank of the River Sava (the modern Croatian word "breg" or "brijeg", meaning "hill", originally meant "river bank"), which is believed to have previously flowed closer to the city centre. Another possible origin is the term "za grabom", meaning "behind the moat", as the city was heavily fortified since its beginnings. [13] [14] 

During Austria-Hungary , Zagreb was more commonly known outside Croatia by its Austrian German exonym "Agram". [15] In today's German though, "Zagreb" prevails. Early Zagreb [ edit ] 

The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus , returning from his campaign against Croatia , founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see , the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral , as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medveščak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ( Gornji Grad ) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia . Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull , which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system . 16th to 18th centuries [ edit ] 

There were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia , first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan . 

At the invitation of the Croatian Parliament , the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school , the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb . 

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague . In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Varaždin to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Varaždin and Karlovac general command.

In the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions. In 1850, the town was united under its first mayor – Janko Kamauf . [17] 

The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks . The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878. 

After the 1880 Zagreb earthquake , up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I , development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today. The first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad , characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907. 

Since 1 January 1877, the Grič cannon is fired daily from the Lotrščak Tower on Grič to mark midday. 

The first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighborhoods like Stara Peščenica in the east and Črnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava , whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars . 

In the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent — the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting out of Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened. [18] 

During World War II , Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia , which was backed by the Nazi Germany and Italians . The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotages, and the Ustaša regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was liberated by the Partisans at the end of the war. Modern Zagreb [ edit ] 

The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II . After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb ), originally called "Južni Zagreb" (Southern Zagreb). [19] The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava , Podsused, Jarun , Blato and other settlements. The cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (Žitnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987. [20] 

During the 1991–1995 Croatian War of Independence , it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks , but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two Zagreb rocket attacks which killed seven civilians. 

An urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zaprešić , Samobor , Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica . Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.

Column 4 is calculated for the territory now defined as the City of Zagreb ( Narodne Novine 97/10). [22] Climate [ edit ] 

The climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate ( Cfb in Köppen climate classification system ), near the boundary of the humid continental climate . Zagreb has four separate seasons . Summers are warm, and winters are cold, without a discernible dry season . The average daily mean temperature in winter is around +1 °C (from December to February) and the average temperature in summer is 22.0 °C (71.6 °F). Temperatures rise above 30 °C (86 °F) on an average 14.6 days each summer. [23] 

Snowfall is common in the winter months, from December to March, and rain and fog are common in autumn (October to December). [24] Highest recorded temperature ever was 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) in July 1950, and lowest was −27.3 °C (−17.1 °F) in February 1956.

Zagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,324 residents, [26] [27] although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher. 

Zagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.2 million inhabitants, [28] as it includes the Zagreb County . [29] Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia . In 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County, [30] although it remains the administrative center of both. 

The majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities : 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.

The most important branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical , pharmaceutical , textile , food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe , the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe . [34] Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor , INA , Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city. 

The only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange ( Croatian : Zagrebačka burza ), which is located in Eurotower , one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers . 

According to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of $ 18,686 and $15,758. [35] 

As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna , about € 870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about €740). [36] [37] At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%. [38] 34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies. [ citation needed ] 

Companies in Zagreb create 52% of total turnover and 60% of total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import. [39] [40] Cityscape [ edit ]

The most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jelačić Square , Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrepčanka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno ( Novi Zagreb – istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973). [41] 

In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower , HOTO Tower , Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower . [42] [43] 

In Novi Zagreb , the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lanište expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre. [44] 

Due to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4–8 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lanište or Kajzerica. [45] Metropolitan administration [ edit ] Zagreb Old City Hall Zagreb City Administration 

According to the Constitution , the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia , has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county . It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb. 

The city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly ( Gradska skupština ) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb ( gradonačelnik Zagreba ) who is the executive head of the city. 

The City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them president and vicepresidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives. 

Prior to 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote ( two-round system ) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb has the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. ⅓ of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register , the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held). 

City administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices , 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services ) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration. The city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly). 

Local government is organized in 17 city districts (or city borroughs ) represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils. [46] City government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Zagreb 

The current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandić ( BM 365 – Party of Labour and Solidarity ). He was elected on 2 June 2013 ( Zagreb local elections 2013 , second round). 

The City Assembly is composed of 51 representatives. Last elections were held on 19 May 2013 ( Zagreb local elections ). The current structure of the city assembly by party lines is as follows: [47] Party Seats Social Democratic Party of Croatia 12 Milan Bandić Electoral list 12 Croatian Democratic Union 8 Croatian Social Liberal Party 4 Milan Bandić 365 - The Party of Labour and Solidarity 4 Croatian Party of Pensioners 3 Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats 2 Croatian Peasant Party 2 Croatian Party of Rights dr.

Zagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways. Until a few years ago, all Croatian highways either started or ended in Zagreb. [ citation needed ] 

The highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka , and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7 , which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest . [48] The A1 starts at the Lučko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange , connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008 [update] Vrgorac ). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb . [ citation needed ] 

Highway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo ) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY . It is the oldest Croatian highway. [49] [50] A3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X . The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing , bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East . This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges. [ citation needed ] 

Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa . [51] It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe . [52] Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Goričan border crossing. It is the least used highway around Zagreb. [ citation needed ] 

The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod , Vinkovci , Osijek and Vukovar ) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. [53] The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb- Macelj ) running through Zagorje , as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Varaždin – Čakovec and Koprivnica ) are linked with truck routes. [54] The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina . [54] [55] Roads [ edit ] Homeland bridge 

The city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass , a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Traffic jams and daytime parking space are a great problem in the wider city centre area during the rush hour . Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tuškanac, Kvaternik Square, Klaić Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east-west arteries, former Highway "Brotherhood and Unity" , consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue , Zagrebačka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue ; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. [ citation needed ] See also: Zagreb bypass Bridges [ edit ] 

Zagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava , and they all span both the river and the levees , making them all by and large longer than 200 m (660 ft). In downstream order, these are: Name (English) Name (Croatian) Year Finished Type of bridge Road that goes over Other Information Podsused Bridge Podsusedski most 1982 Two-lane road bridge with a commuter train line (not yet completed) Samoborska Road Connects Zagreb to its close suburbs by a road to Samobor , the fastest route to Bestovje, Sveta Nedelja and Strmec. Jankomir Bridge Jankomirski most 1958, 2006 (upgrade) Four lane road bridge Ljubljanska Avenue Connects Ljubljanska Avenue to the Jankomir interchange and Zagreb bypass .

The bridge spans from Savska Street in the north to the Remetinec Roundabout in the south. Sava Bridge Savski most 1938 Pedestrian since the construction of the Adriatic Bridge Savska Road The official name at the time of building was New Sava bridge, but it is the oldest still standing bridge over Sava . The bridge is known among experts due to some construction details. [56] Liberty Bridge Most slobode 1959 Four lane road bridge Većeslav Holjevac Avenue It used to hold a pair of bus lanes , but due to the increasing individual traffic and better tram connections across the river, those were converted to normal lanes. Youth Bridge Most mladosti 1974 Six lane road bridge (also carries tram tracks) Marin Držić Avenue Connects eastern Novi Zagreb to the districts of Trnje , Peščenica , Donja Dubrava and Maksimir . Homeland Bridge Domovinski most 2007 Four-lane road bridge (also carries two bicycle and two pedestrian lanes; has space reserved for light railroad tracks) Radnička (Workers') Road This bridge is the last bridge built on Sava to date; it links Peščenica via Radnička street to the Zagreb bypass at Kosnica. It is planned to continue towards Zagreb Airport at Pleso and Velika Gorica , and on to state road D31 going to the south. 

There are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mičevec , as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass , one near Zaprešić (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east). 

Two additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge. Public transportation [ edit ] Main Railway Station ZET tram and city bus Newest model of the Zagreb city trains system New terminal of the Zagreb International Airport 

Public transportation in the city is organized in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams , the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail . 

The public transportation company ZET ( Zagrebački električni tramvaj , Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidized by the city council. 

The national rail operator Croatian Railways ( Hrvatske željeznice , HŽ) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation . 

The funicular ( uspinjača ) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction . 

Taxis are readily available through a network of around 3000 taxi vehicles, [57] but this type of Zagreb's public transport hadn't been particularly popular among the residents until the end of the 2000s due to the monopoly of only one taxi company. In early 2010, numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards. Tram network [ edit ] Main article: Trams in Zagreb 

Zagreb has an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30–50 kilometres per hour (19–31 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour . The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts. 

An ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Končar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by TŽV Gredelj , has recently been finished. The new " TMK 2200 ", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet. [58] Suburban rail network [ edit ] Main article: Zagreb Commuter Rail 

The commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east-west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city. [59] 

A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samoborček was closed in the 1970s. [60] Air traffic [ edit ] Main article: Zagreb International Airport 

Zagreb Airport ( IATA : ZAG , ICAO : LDZA ) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km (11 mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica . The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft . [61] The airport had slightly less than 2.5 million passengers in 2012, but in September 2013 a new terminal is to be built and the airport will be able to receive more than 5 million passengers after the end of construction. 

Zagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lučko ( ICAO : LDZL ). It is home to sports airplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lučko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959. [62] 

A third, small grass airfield, Buševec, is located just outside Velika Gorica . It is primarily used for sports purposes. [63] Cultural sites [ edit ] Museums [ edit ] Croatian State Archives Mimara Museum Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Meštrović Pavilion Museum of Contemporary Art

[88] In total there are around 40 non-Catholic religious organizations and denominations in Zagreb with their headquarters and places of worship across the city making it a large and diverse multicultural community. Surroundings [ edit ] Further information: Zagreb County , Krapina–Zagorje County , and Sisak–Moslavina County Shrine of the Homeland Medvedgrad fortress 

The wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of Šćitarjevo. 

Picturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, Šestine, Gračani and Remete, maintain their rich traditions , including folk costumes, Šestine umbrellas ( hr ) , and gingerbread products. 

To the north is the Medvednica Mountain ( Croatian : Zagrebačka gora ), with its highest peak Sljeme (1,035 m), where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament. 

From the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighboring Slovenia . There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift. 

The old Medvedgrad , a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland , a memorial with an eternal flame , where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays . The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year. 

Zagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of Žumberak - Medvednica fault zone. [89] It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. [90] The area around Medvednica was the epicenter of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. [91] The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. [91] Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalinić stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded. [92] Tourism [ edit ] 

Zagreb is an important tourist center, not only in terms of passengers traveling from the rest of Europe to the Adriatic Sea, but also as a travel destination itself. Since the end of the war , it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from Austria , Germany and Italy . However, the city has even greater potential as many tourists that visit Croatia skip Zagreb in order to visit the beaches along the Croatian Adriatic coast and old historic Renaissance cities such as Dubrovnik , Split , and Zadar . There are many interesting things for tourists in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Marshal Tito Square , the other at Kamenita vrata , where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovićeva street, called Nine Views . Most people don't know what the statue "Prizemljeno Sunce" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun.

A volleyball sports hall is within the park. Sports and Recreational Center Šalata, located in Šalata , only a couple hundred meters from the Jelačić Square , is most attractive for tennis players. It comprises a big tennis court and eight smaller ones, two of which are covered by the so-called "balloon", and another two equipped with lights. The center also has swimming pools, basketball courts, football fields, a gym and fitness center, and a four-lane bowling alley. Outdoor ice skating is a popular winter recreation. There are also several fine restaurants within and near the center. 

Maksimir Tennis Center, located in Ravnice east of downtown , consists of two sports blocks. The first comprises a tennis center situated in a large tennis hall with four courts. There are 22 outdoor tennis courts with lights. The other block offers multipurpose sports facilities: apart from tennis courts, there are handball, basketball and indoor football grounds, as well as track and field facilities, a bocci ball alley and table tennis opportunities.

The 38,923 [98] -seat Maksimir Stadium , last 10 years under renovation, is located in Maksimir in the northeastern part of the city. The stadium is part of the immense Svetice recreational and sports complex (ŠRC Svetice), south of the Maksimir Park. The complex covers an area of 276,440 m 2 (68 acres). It is part of a significant Green Zone , which passes from Medvednica Mountains in the north toward the south. ŠRC Svetice, together with Maksimir Park, creates an ideal connection of areas which are assigned to sport, recreation and leisure. 

The latest larger recreational facility is Bundek , a group of two small lakes near the Sava in Novi Zagreb , surrounded by a partly forested park. The location had been used prior to the 1970s, but then went to neglect until 2006 when it was renovated.

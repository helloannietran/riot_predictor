Buffalo ( / ˈ b ʌ f ə l oʊ / ) is a city in Western New York and the seat of Erie County , on the eastern shores of Lake Erie at the head of the Niagara River . As of 2014 [update] , Buffalo is the state's second most populous city after New York City with 258,703 residents, and with a population of 1.13 million, the metropolitan area is the 50th largest in the United States. 

Buffalo grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of the Erie Canal , railroads and Lake Erie, providing an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the Midwestern United States , while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries during the 20th century. After an economic downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to sectors that include financial services, technology, biomedical and education. 

Residents of Buffalo are called " Buffalonians ". The city's nicknames include "The Queen City", "The Nickel City", and "The City of Good Neighbors". [1]

Etymology [ edit ] 

The city of Buffalo received its name from a nearby creek called Buffalo Creek . [2] British military engineer Captain John Montresor made reference to 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of 1764, which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name. [3] There are several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name. [4] [5] [6] While it is possible that Buffalo Creek's name originated from French fur traders and Native Americans calling the creek Beau Fleuve ( French for "Beautiful River"), [4] [5] it is also possible that Buffalo Creek was named for the American buffalo , whose historical range may have extended into Western New York . [6] [7] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Buffalo, New York 1630s: The French report the Wenro' s territory was north and east of the Erie peoples , East of the Neutral people across the Niagara River and west of the Genesee River valley and the Genesee Gorge across which the Seneca people had their home. Bird's-eye view of Buffalo in 1873 Women workers leave the Republic Steel plant, with open hearth furnaces in the background. Steel production at Bethlehem Steel on the shores of Lake Erie, 1973 Early history [ edit ] 

Prior to European colonization, French observers report the region's inhabitants were an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large Neutral Nation called the Wenro people or 'Wenrohronon', who lived along the south shore of Lake Ontario and east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its southern shore. Later, during the 1640s–50s Beaver Wars , the combined warriors of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals [8] and their peninsular territory, [8] while the Senecas alone took out their weak neighbors, the Wenrohronon, and their territory, c. 1651 [8] [9] –1653 [10] 

In 1804, as principal agent opening the area for the Holland Land Company , the architect of Washington D.C., Joseph Ellicott , designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes similar to the street system he used in the nation's capital. Although Ellicott named the settlement "New Amsterdam," the name did not catch on. [11] 

During the War of 1812 , on December 30, 1813, [ citation needed ] Buffalo was burned by British forces. [12] 

On October 26, 1825, [13] the Erie Canal was completed with Buffalo a port-of-call for settlers heading westward. [14] At the time, the population was about 2,400. [15] The Erie Canal brought about a surge in population and commerce, which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832. [16] 

In 1845, construction began on the Macedonia Baptist Church , an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. [ better source needed ] Buffalo was a terminus point of the Underground Railroad with many fugitive slaves crossing the Niagara River to Fort Erie, Ontario in search of freedom. [17] 

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo. [18] [ better source needed ] Grain and commercial goods shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor. [ citation needed ] In 1843, the world's first steam-powered grain elevator was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart and engineer Robert Dunbar . [19] " Dart's Elevator " enabled faster unloading of lake freighters along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from barges, canal boats, and rail cars. [20] By 1850, the city's population was 81,000. [16] 20th century [ edit ] 

At the dawn of the 20th century, local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectric power generated by the Niagara River. The city got the nickname City of Light at this time due to the widespread electric lighting. [ citation needed ] It was also part of the automobile revolution, hosting the brass era car builders Pierce Arrow and the Seven Little Buffaloes early in the century. [21] President William McKinley was shot and mortally wounded at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. [22] He died in the city eight days later [23] and Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion as the 26th President of the United States. [23] 

The Great Depression of 1929-39 saw severe unemployment, especially among working class men. The New Deal relief programs operated full force. The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party. [24] During World War II , Buffalo saw the return of prosperity and full employment due to its position as a manufacturing center. [25] [26] 

With the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; deindustrialization; and the nationwide trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate. [27] [28] Like much of the Rust Belt , Buffalo, home to more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline as heavy industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities. [27] [28] [29] Modern history [ edit ] 

Like other rust belt cities such as Pittsburgh and Cleveland , Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. In the early 2010s, growth from local colleges and universities continued to spur economic development. Buffalo from Lake Erie, c. 1911. Geography and climate [ edit ] 

Buffalo is on Lake Erie 's eastern end, opposite Fort Erie, Ontario, and at the beginning of the Niagara River, which flows northward over Niagara Falls and into Lake Ontario . The city is 50 miles (80 km) south-southeast from Toronto . Buffalo's position on Lake Erie, facing westward, makes it one of the few major cities on the East Coast to have sunsets over a body of water. 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 52.5 square miles (136 km 2 ), of which 40.6 square miles (105 km 2 ) is land and 11.9 square miles (31 km 2 ) is water. The total area is 22.66% water. Cityscape [ edit ] See also: List of tallest buildings in Buffalo Skyline of Buffalo, looking east from Lake Erie. Aerial view of Buffalo's skyline.

On the far right is One Seneca Tower , formerly the HSBC Building. Architecture [ edit ] Elmwood Village 2001 image of the Niagara Peninsula , Niagara Falls and Buffalo from NASA 's Terra satellite . Main article: Architecture of Buffalo, New York 

Buffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection of buildings the 19th and 20th centuries. [30] Most structures and works are still standing, such as the country's largest intact parks system designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux . [31] At the end of the 19th century, the Guaranty Building —constructed by Louis Sullivan —was a prominent example of an early high-rise skyscraper. [32] [33] The 20th century saw works such as the Art Deco -style Buffalo City Hall and Buffalo Central Terminal , Electric Tower , the Richardson Olmsted Complex , and the Rand Building . Urban renewal from the 1950s–1970s gave way to the construction of the Brutalist -style Buffalo City Court Building and the One Seneca Tower —formerly the HSBC Center, the city's tallest building. [34] Winter snow storm, 2014 Cherry blossoms in spring Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Buffalo, New York Climate [ edit ] 

Buffalo has a continental-type climate, which is common in the Great Lakes region. ( Köppen climate classification "Dfb" – uniform precipitation distribution). [35] [36] 

Buffalo has snowy winters, but it is rarely the snowiest city in New York State . [37] [38] The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated on land and on frozen Lake Erie. [39] Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage during the autumn as with the October 2006 storm . [40] [41] In November 2014, the region had a record-breaking storm , producing over 5½ feet of snow. [42] 

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the Northeast , but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush. [36] Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate humidity and temperature. [36] 

Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days. [36] As a result, temperatures only rise above 90 °F (32.2 °C) three times per year, [36] and the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or more. [43] Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. Lake Erie's stabilizing effect continues to inhibit thunderstorms and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. [36] August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence. [36] 

The highest recorded temperature in Buffalo was 99 °F (37 °C) on August 27, 1948, [44] and the lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C) on February 9, 1934 and February 2, 1961. [45]

Like most former industrial cities of the Great Lakes region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression from suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, was significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's population was equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change. [ citation needed ] 

At the 2010 Census , the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. [56] 

Since 2003 there has been an ever growing number of Burmese refugees, mostly of the Karen ethnicity, with an estimated 4,665 now residing in Buffalo. [57] 

The median income for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

Buffalo's economic sectors include industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and services. [ citation needed ] 

The State of New York , with over 15,000 employees, is the city's largest employer. [58] Other major employers include the United States government , Kaleida Health , M T Bank , the University at Buffalo , General Motors , Time Warner Cable , and Tops Friendly Markets .

Buffalo is home to Rich Products , Canadian brewer Labatt , cheese company Sorrento Lactalis , Delaware North Companies [59] and New Era Cap Company . 

The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high labor costs have led to economic decline and made Buffalo one of the poorest U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7–29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, behind either only Detroit, [60] or only Detroit and Cleveland . [61] Buffalo's median household income of $27,850 is third-lowest among large cities, behind only Miami and Cleveland; however the metropolitan area's median household income is $57,000. [62] This, in part, has led to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. [ citation needed ] As of 2014 [update] , the median home price in the city was $95,000. [63] 

Buffalo's economy has begun to see significant improvements since the early 2010s.

Parks and recreation [ edit ] Main article: Buffalo, New York parks system View of Canalside and Buffalo Naval Park Lake within Delaware Park 

The Buffalo parks system has over 20 parks with several parks accessible from any part of the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed in 1868 by Frederick Law Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux , the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy (BOPC), a non-profit, for public benefit corporation which serves as the cities parks department. It is the first non-governmental organization of its kind to serve in such a capacity in the US. [94] 

Situated at the confluence of Lake Erie and the Buffalo River and Niagara Rivers, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of transshipment , manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry. 

Beginning in 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront began to be transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. To this end, Buffalo Harbor State Park , nicknamed "Outer Harbor", was opened in 2014. [95] Buffalo's intent was to stress its architectural and historical heritage to create a tourism destination, and early data indicates that they were successful.

In a trend common to northern " Rust Belt " regions, the Democratic Party has dominated Buffalo's political life for the last half-century. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was Chester A. Kowal in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor James D. Griffin was elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the Conservative Party and the Right to Life Party , after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker Arthur Eve . Griffin switched political allegiances several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat Anthony M. Masiello (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on social conservatism , often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat Byron Brown was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over Republican Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform. In 2013, the Conservative Party endorsed Brown because of his pledge to cut taxes. [ citation needed ] 

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and on the edge of bankruptcy. At New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi 's urging, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Mayor Tony Masiello began conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government the following year, but they came to naught.

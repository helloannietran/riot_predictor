Rochester ( / ˈ r ɒ tʃ ᵻ s t ər / or / ˈ r ɒ ˌ tʃ ɛ s t ər / ) is a city on the southern shore of Lake Ontario in the western portion of the U.S. state of New York , and the seat of Monroe County . 

The city's population (210,565) was the state's third largest — after New York City and Buffalo — at the time of the 2010 census . Rochester is the center of a larger metropolitan area that encompasses and extends beyond Monroe County , and comprises Genesee County , Livingston County , Ontario County , Orleans County and Wayne County . This area, which is part of the Western New York region, had a population of 1,079,671 at the time of the 2010 Census . A Census estimate of July 1, 2012, raised that number to 1,082,284. [2] 

Rochester was one of America's first boomtowns, and rose to prominence as the site of many flour mills along the Genesee River , and then as a major hub of manufacturing. [ citation needed ] Several of the region's universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology ) have renowned research programs. In addition, Rochester is the site of many important inventions and innovations in consumer products. The Rochester area has been the birthplace to such corporations as Kodak , Bausch Lomb , and Xerox that conduct extensive research and manufacturing in the fields of industrial and consumer products. Until 2010, the Rochester metropolitan area was the second-largest regional economy in New York State, according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , after the New York City metropolitan area . [3] Rochester's GMP has since ranked just below that of Buffalo, New York , while still exceeding it in per-capita income . [4] 

The 25th edition of the Places Rated Almanac rated Rochester as the "most livable city" in 2007, among three hundred seventy nine U.S. metropolitan areas . [5] In 2010 Forbes rated Rochester as the third best place to raise a family. [6] In 2012 Kiplinger rated Rochester as the fifth best city for families, citing low cost of living, top public schools, and a low jobless rate. [7] 

Of the 19 places in the United States named Rochester at least 8 were named directly after Rochester, New York, having been founded or settled by former residents. These include Rochester, Indiana ; Rochester, Texas ; Rochester, Iowa ; Rochester, Kentucky ; Rochester, Michigan ; Rochester, Minnesota ; Rochester, Nevada ; and Rochester, Ohio .

The Seneca tribe of Native Americans lived in and around Rochester until they lost their claim to most of this land in the Treaty of Big Tree in 1797. [8] Settlement before the Seneca tribe is unknown. 

Development of modern Rochester followed the American Revolution , and forced cession of their territory by the Iroquois after the defeat of Great Britain. Allied with the British, four major Iroquois tribes were essentially forced from New York. As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown, they were given a large land grant on the Grand River in Canada. 

Rochester was founded shortly after the American Revolution by a wave of English-Puritan descended immigrants from New England who were looking for new agricultural land. They would be the dominant cultural group in Rochester for over a century. [9] On November 8, 1803, Col. Nathaniel Rochester (1752–1831), Maj. Charles Carroll, and Col. William Fitzhugh, Jr. (1761–1839), all of Hagerstown, Maryland , purchased a 100-acre (ca. 40 ha ) tract from the state in Western New York along the Genesee River . They chose the site because its three cataracts on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. Beginning in 1811, and with a population of 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out streets and tracts. In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville. Bridge originally built as an aqueduct for the Erie Canal in 1842, replacing the original construction from 1823. It was subsequently used for subway trains and, in the 1920s, the Broad Street Bridge was erected on top of it. This photograph shows how it appeared in 2002. 

By 1821, Rochesterville was the seat of Monroe County. In 1823, Rochesterville consisted of 1,012 acres (4 km 2 ) and 2,500 residents, and the Village of Rochesterville became known as Rochester. Also in 1823, the Erie Canal aqueduct over the Genesee River was completed, and the Erie Canal east to the Hudson River was opened. (In the early 20th century, after the advent of railroads , the presence of the canal in the center city was an obstacle; it was re-routed south of Rochester.) By 1830, Rochester's population was 9,200 and in 1834, it was re-chartered as a city. 

Rochester was first known as "the Young Lion of the West", and then as the "Flour City". By 1838, Rochester was the largest flour-producing city in the United States. Having doubled its population in only ten years, Rochester became America's first " boomtown ". Rochester experienced one of the nation's biggest revivalist movements, led by Charles Finney. 

By the mid-19th century, as the center of the wheat-processing industry moved west with population and agriculture, the city became home to an expanding nursery business, giving rise to the city's second nickname , the "Flower City." Large and small nurseries ringed the city, the most famous of which was started in 1840 by immigrants Georg Ellwanger from Germany and Patrick Barry from Ireland.

In 1847, Frederick Douglass founded the abolitionist newspaper The North Star in Rochester. Douglass, a former slave and an antislavery speaker and writer, gained a circulation of over 4,000 readers in the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. The North Star served as a forum for abolitionist views. The Douglass home burnt down in 1872, but a marker for it can be found in Highland Park off South Avenue. [11] 

Susan B. Anthony , a national leader of the women's suffrage movement, was from Rochester. The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which guaranteed the right of women to vote in 1920, was popularly known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment because of her decades of work toward its passage, which she did not live to see. [12] Anthony's home is now a National Historic Landmark known as the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House . [13] 

At the end of the 19th century, anarchist Emma Goldman lived and worked in Rochester for several years, where she championed the cause of labor in Rochester sweatshops. Rochester was also home to significant unrest in labor, race, and antiwar protests. Hundreds of Vietnam demonstrators block traffic on Main Street in May 1971 in Rochester, New York. 

After the Civil War, Rochester had an expansion of new industries in the late 19th century, founded by migrants to the city, such as inventor and entrepreneur George Eastman , who founded Eastman Kodak ; and German immigrants John Jacob Bausch and Henry Lomb , who combined technical and financial expertise to launch Bausch Lomb in 1861. Not only did they create new industries and thousands of jobs, but Eastman became a major philanthropist , developing and endowing the University of Rochester , its Eastman School of Music and other local institutions. 

In the early 20th century, Rochester became a center of the garment industry, particularly men's fashions. It was the base of enterprises such as Bond Clothing Stores , Fashion Park Clothes , Hickey Freeman , and Stein-Bloch Co. The carriage maker James Cunningham and Sons founded a pioneer automobile company – Cunningham. [14] 

The population reached 62,386 in 1870, 162,608 in 1900 and 295,750 in 1920. By 1950, the population had reached a high of 332,488. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Rochester's population as 97.6% white and 2.3% black. [15] With industrial restructuring in the later 20th century, and the decline of industry and jobs in the area, by 2010, the city's population had declined to 210,565, although the metropolitan area was considerably larger. Geography and climate [ edit ] Urban Rochester as seen from the air 

Rochester is at 43°9′56″N 77°36′41″W ﻿ / ﻿ 43.16556°N 77.61139°W ﻿ / 43.16556; -77.61139 (43.165496, −77.611504). [16] The city is about 65 miles (100 km) east-northeast of Buffalo and about 75 miles (120 km) west of Syracuse ; it sits on Lake Ontario 's southern shore. The Genesee River bisects the city. New York City is about 250 miles (400 km) to the southeast. 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 37.1 square miles (96 km 2 ), of which 35.8 square miles (93 km 2 ) of it is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km 2 ) of it (3.42%) is water.

Rochester's geography was formed by the ice sheets during the Pleistocene epoch. The retreating ice sheets reached a standstill at what is now the southern border of the city, melting at the same rate as they were advancing, depositing sediment along the southern edge of the ice mass. This created a line of hills, including (from west to east) Mt. Hope, the hills of Highland Park, Pinnacle Hill, and Cobb's Hill. Because the sediment of these hills was deposited into a proglacial lake, they are stratified and classified as a " kame delta ". A brief retreat and readvance of the ice sheet onto the delta deposited unstratified material there, creating a rare hybrid structure called a " kame moraine ". 

The ice sheets also created Lake Ontario (one of the five fresh-water Great Lakes ), the Genesee River with its waterfalls and gorges , Irondequoit Bay , Sodus Bay , Braddock Bay , Mendon Ponds , numerous local streams and ponds, the Ridge, and the nearby Finger Lakes . 

According to the City of Rochester, the city has 537 miles (864 km) of public streets, 585 miles (941 km) of water mains, 44 vehicular and eight pedestrian bridges, 11 public libraries, two police stations (one for the east side, one for the west), and 15 firehouses. The principal source of water is Hemlock Lake , which, with its watershed, is owned by the state of New York. Other water sources include Canadice Lake and Lake Ontario . The 30-year annual average snowfall is just above 100 in (2.5 m). [17] The monthly daily average ranges from 24.7 °F (−4.1 °C) in January to 70.8 °F (21.6 °C) in July. The high amount of snow that Rochester receives can be accounted for by the city's proximity to Lake Ontario (see lake effect ). 

Rochester lies in the humid continental climate zone ( Köppen Dfb ) [18] and has four distinct seasons, with cold and snowy winters; temperatures drop to 0 °F (−18 °C) on 4.2 nights annually. Autumn features brilliant foliage colors, and summer sees generally comfortable temperatures that usually stay in the range of 80 to 85 °F (27 to 29 °C) accompanied by moderate to high humidity; there are only 6.9 days annually of highs more than 90 °F (32 °C). Precipitation is plentiful year round.

Over the course of the past 50 years Rochester has become a major center for immigration, particularly for arrivals from Eastern and Southeastern Europe, Subsaharan Africa and the Caribbean. Rochester has the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any major city in the United States, [25] one of the four largest Turkish American communities, [29] one of the largest Jamaican American communities in any major U.S city [30] and a large concentration of Polish Americans along with nearby Buffalo, New York .

[32] At that time, the city added, on average, 2.6 new congregations per year, many founded by immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. [32] During peak immigration from 1900–1920 dozens of churches were established, including four Roman Catholic churches with Italian clergy, three Roman Catholic churches with Slavic clergy, Polish Baptist church, 15 Jewish synagogues , and four small Italian Protestant mission churches: Baptist, Evangelical , Methodist , and Presbyterian .

Tech Valley , the technologically recognized area of eastern New York State, has spawned a western offshoot into the Rochester and Finger Lakes areas. Since the 2000s, as the more established companies in Rochester downsized, Rochester and Monroe County's economy has been redirected toward high technology , with new, smaller companies providing the seed capital necessary for business foundation. The Rochester area is important in the field of photographic processing and imaging as well as incubating an increasingly diverse high technology sphere encompassing STEM fields , in part the result of private startup enterprises collaborating with major academic institutions, including the University of Rochester and Cornell University . [40] Other organizations such as High Tech Rochester provide local startups with mentorship, office space, and other resources. [41] Given the high prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging.

The city's police department is the Rochester Police Department , headed by Chief of Police Michael L. Ciminelli. Neighborhood Service Centers [ edit ] 

Enforcement of property code violations in Rochester had been handled by the Neighborhood Empowerment Team, or NET. Rather than utilizing a centralized code-enforcement office, 10 sectors in Rochester were assigned a total of six NET offices by the city government. However, there had been complaints about the lack of consistency in the manner and severity of enforcement between NET offices. On July 16, 2008, the city announced that two of the NET offices would be closed and another relocated, due to what it had found to be the high cost and low value of operating the decentralized network. [50] Following the restructuring, the remaining offices were renamed Neighborhood Service Centers, or NSCs. There is now one office per city quadrant which resolve quality of life issues, work with neighborhood groups, and pave the way for appropriate housing and economic development. [51] The majority of code enforcement processes were consolidated into the Bureau of Inspection and Compliance within the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development located centrally in City Hall.

The neighborhood borders the nearby Tryon and Ellison Parks. The Browncroft Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. [62] 14621 community [ edit ] 

Extending across much of the north-central cityscape of Rochester, now including parts of the old Hudson Avenue and North Clinton neighborhoods, is the 14621 community. Today this neighborhood is predominantly Black and Hispanic, this community suffered being the center of the 1964 riots. [63] The riots did produce some benefits in the long run: the north-central area has been the site of ongoing urban renewal projects since the late 1960s, and, as noted by JULY '64 filmmakers Carvin Eison and Chris Christopher, inspired the development of such important Black organizations such as The Urban League of Rochester as well as Rochester's first anti-poverty organization (Action for a Better Community), and black community activist organization Freedom, Integration, God, Honor, Today (F.I.G.H.T.) founded by Rev. Franklin Florence and Deleon McEwen, the latter was its first president. The establishment of this program came through the assistance of Saul Alinsky . The neighborhood is still considered the most dangerous part of Rochester and is blighted by crime, drugs and gang activity. [64] Lyell Avenue [ edit ] 

Once an Italian-American neighborhood, there have recently been efforts to improve the quality of life in this neighborhood. It is known largely for its crime, especially instances of prostitution and drug sales. [ citation needed ] 19th Ward [ edit ] 

The 19th Ward is a southwest neighborhood bordered by Genesee Street, West Avenue, the Erie Canal, and is across the river from the University of Rochester. [65] Now known by its slogan "Urban by Choice", in the early 19th century the area was known as Castle Town, after Castle Inn, a tavern run by Colonel Isaac Castle. By the early 1820s however, the area became overshadowed by developments in the north that would later become downtown Rochester. Due to a tumultuous bend in the Genesee river, the area was home to skilled boatsmen that assisted boats traveling north to Rochester and the area was consequently known during this time as "The Rapids". In the 1890s, as Rochester expanded, the area became a prosperous residential area that thrived as the city grew. By 1930 it was a booming residential area for doctors, lawyers, and skilled workers; it includes the still prestigious Sibley Tract development. Homes in the originally upper-class neighborhood typically have gumwood trim, leaded glass, fireplaces, hardwood floors, and open porches. In the 1960s, property values declined as the population of Rochester did, the area experienced white flight accelerated by school busing, blockbusting , and race riots downtown, and crime increased, with violence, drug use , and neglected property further diminishing property values. [66] 

To respond to these issues, the 19th Ward has had an active community association since 1965, and is now known for its ethnic, class, and cultural diversity. [ vague ] The current "Brooks Landing" development along the Genesee River at the former "rapids" is successfully bringing new economic development to the community including an 88-room hotel, 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m 2 ) office building, 11,000 square feet (1,000 m 2 ) of new retail, two restaurants, and Boulder Coffee shop. [67] Residential development is also increasing with completion of a 170-bed University of Rochester student housing tower at Brooks Landing in 2014, and 29 new market-rate homes nearby. 

Located in the 19th Ward are the Arvine Heights Historic District , Chili–West Historic District , Inglewood and Thurston Historic District , and Sibley–Elmdorf Historic District , listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [68] [69] [70] Charlotte [ edit ] Ontario Beach County Park in the Charlotte neighborhood of Rochester. 

Charlotte (shar-LOT) is a lake front community in Rochester bordering Lake Ontario . It is home to Ontario Beach Park, commonly known as Charlotte Beach, which is a popular summer destination for Rochesterians. A new terminal was built in 2004 for the Rochester-to-Toronto ferry service and was later sold after the ferry ceased operations in 2005. The Port of Rochester terminal still exists and has since been revamped. It now houses the restaurant California Rollin', a coffee shop named The Nutty Bavarian along with offices for the marina that has been created around it. In summer 2016 a proposed redevelopment project for the Port of Rochester was put on hold due to the developers failing to meet financial obligations as set by the city. [71] Corn Hill [ edit ] 

The Corn Hill neighborhood near downtown is one of the nation's best-preserved Victorian neighborhoods and a center for art. It is also home to Corn Hill Landing, a shopping and housing strip located on the Genesee River. The annual Corn Hill Art Festival, a two-day event held on the weekend after the 4th of July, is one of the city's most popular gatherings for the display of art. Corn Hill is one of Rochester's smaller neighborhoods. The neighborhood name came about because (allegedly) in the early settlement days, those traveling the fast-flowing Genesee River could see a large-sized rolling hill covered with corn which had been planted by the immigrating Scots and English. By the late 1800s and well into the 1920s, Cornhill was home to some of the wealthiest families. Situated on the southern edge of downtown, the neighborhood allowed for a short carriage ride or walk to the banks and businesses of New York's third-largest city. Upper Monroe [ edit ] 

Located less than one and one-half miles from downtown, Upper Monroe encompasses 17 streets with 1400 households and approximately 3300 residents. Cobbs Hill Park, with its beautiful reservoir, tennis courts and athletic fields, forms the southeastern boundary of this neighborhood. Highland Park, world-renowned for its annual Lilac Festival, also is within walking distance. [72] The Upper Monroe Neighborhood Association (UMNA) is a not-for-profit advocacy group representing the residents and property owners of the Upper Monroe neighborhood. Its goals are to ascertain the needs and concerns of the neighborhood and take positive action to address those needs and concerns. [73] The neighborhood is also home to a number of small, local businesses including: Hardpact, Huey's Hair Company, Monty's Krown, Jeremiah's Tavern, and Park Ave. Pets. [74] East End [ edit ]

Maplewood [ edit ] A portion of the skyline of Rochester from a northeast perspective along the Genesee River . 

Maplewood is a northwest neighborhood located south of Eastman Business Park and between the Genesee River and Dewey Avenue. Much of the area's charm comes from the use of parkways as well as parks and greenspace bordering the river. These features are the result of plans designed by Frederick Law Olmsted . The Maplewood Rose Garden is the second-largest rose test garden in the United States. The Maplewood Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. [62] North Winton Village [ edit ]

[75] The area is bordered by Byron Street in the north, South Clinton Avenue and Interstate 490 on its east, Highland Park on its south, and The Genesee River on the west. Construction of the Erie Canal (the old canal bed which went by the neighborhood is now used by Interstate 490) brought workers to the area, who set up camps for the months that it took to complete this section of the canal. [76] This racially integrated [ citation needed ] neighborhood is one of the neighborhoods in Rochester currently undergoing the process of gentrification, partially due to a recent increase in homeownership in the area.

The "Wedge" is quickly becoming one of the most vibrant areas within the city limits, its numerous nightspots keeping the streets busy with college students and young professionals (many of whom live there due to the abundance of affordable housing, thriving nightlife and proximity to many of the region's major hospitals, parks and colleges) Park lands [ edit ] Lamberton Conservatory from 1911 in the Highland Park

Numerous golf magazines have praised Rochester for its rich passion for the game and its high level of competition. [ citation needed ] College sports [ edit ] 

Rochester is the largest Metropolitan Statistical Area in the U.S. which does not include at least one college or university participating at the NCAA Division I level in all sports. Almost all area college sports are played at the NCAA Division III level. The only exceptions are the RIT men's and women's ice hockey teams, which compete at the Division I level. RIT's other sports, as well as the Institute as a whole, are classified as being part of Division III. The men's team made it to the NCAA Frozen Four in 2010 and the women's team won the Division III national championship in 2012, just before switching over to Division I. 

As of the 2014–2015 academic year, the only college in the Rochester area not officially classified at the Division III level is Roberts Wesleyan College , which completed its transition from membership in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA); Roberts Wesleyan was granted full membership in NCAA Division II beginning with the 2014–15 year. [116] Rugby [ edit ]

There is marine freight service at the Port of Rochester on Lake Ontario , which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway . 

A short-lived, high-speed passenger/vehicle ferry Spirit of Ontario I built in Australia, nicknamed The Breeze or The Fast Ferry, linked Rochester to Toronto across Lake Ontario. Canadian American Transportation Systems (CATS) was the company in charge of the Fast Ferry operations. The Spirit of Ontario I had a delayed arrival on April 29, 2004 as a result of hitting a pier in New York City on April 5, 2004 and was finally officially christened on June 16, 2004 at the Port of Rochester. The Fast Ferry was bought by the City of Rochester in an attempt to save the project. The Fast Ferry operated between June 17, 2004, and December 12, 2005, and cost the city $42.5 million. The project was initially well received by inhabitants of Rochester. Considerable effort was spent by inhabitants of Rochester to build up the waterfront to embrace the idea as well as to capitalize on potential tourism which was estimated to be an additional 75,000 tourists per month. In the first three months of operation the fast ferry had carried about 140,000 people between Rochester and Toronto. A second Fast Ferry was proposed by CATS on August 27, 2004 which would have cost an additional $100 Million. Due to a number of problems concerning the ship's engine (June 6, 2004 blown gasket and September 2004 to June 2005) requiring costly repairs, the lack of mutual building up of waterfronts in Toronto and the inability of the city to put pressure on the company responsible for the production of the Fast Ferry yielded in the failure of the project. It was sold to Förde Reederei Seetouristik , a German company, for $30 million. The mayor at the time was William A. Johnson, Jr. and was succeeded by Robert Duffy on January 1, 2006. Air transport [ edit ] 

Rochester is served by the Greater Rochester International Airport (GRIA). Daily scheduled air service is provided by Air Canada , American , Delta , JetBlue , Southwest , and United . Many of these airlines do not operate mainline service to Rochester; rather, they contract regional airlines to operate flights on their own, smaller aircraft. 

In 2010, the GRIA was ranked the 14th-least expensive airport in the United States by Cheapflights . [118] This was considered a major achievement for the county and the airport authority; as recently as 2003, Rochester's ticket prices were among the highest in the country, ranking as high as fourth in 1999. [119] [120] 

FedEx founder Fred Smith has stated in numerous articles that Xerox 's development of the copier, and its need to quickly get parts to customers, was one of the economic issues that led him to pioneer the overnight delivery business in 1971. [ citation needed ] Because Xerox manufactured its copiers in Rochester [ citation needed ] , the city was one of the original 25 cities that FedEx served on its first night of operations on April 17, 1973. [121] Rails and mass transit [ edit ] See also: Rochester station (New York) 

Prior to the Amtrak Station, Rochester had a smaller version of New York City's " Grand Central Station ." It was among Claude Fayette Bragdon's best works in Rochester, New York. 

Rochester used to be a major stop on several railroad lines. It was served by the New York Central Railroad which served Chicago and Buffalo to the west and Albany and New York City to the east and southeast. The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway (absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ) served Buffalo and Pittsburgh until 1955. A rail route to Salamanca in southern New York State afforded connections in Salamanca to southwestern and southeastern New York State. [122] The last long-distance train in a southern direction was the Northern Express / Southern Express that went to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania via Canandaigua, Elmira and Williamsport; service ended in 1971. [123] 

Amtrak (passenger) and freight lines provide rail service to Rochester. Rochester has intercity and transcontinental bus service via Greyhound and Trailways . 

Local bus service in Rochester and its county suburbs is provided by the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA) via its Regional Transit Service (RTS) subsidiary. RTS also provides suburban service outside the immediate Rochester area and runs smaller transportation systems in outlying counties, such as WATS (Wayne Area Transportation System). 

From 1927 to 1957, Rochester had a light rail underground transit system called the Rochester Subway . It was the smallest city in the world to have one. Over the years there have been privately sponsored proposals put forth that encourage the region to support a new system, possibly using some of the old tunnels. One includes converting the Broad Street bridge tunnel—the former canal aqueduct—into an enhanced pedestrian corridor, which would also include a Rochester Transportation Museum, and a tram system. The Broad Street Aqueduct was used as a subway tunnel 

The former canal and subway tunnels have become a frequent source of debate. Several city homeless use the tunnels for shelter, and a few areas near tunnel entrances have gained the reputation as being dangerous. The city has considered multiple solutions for the space including recreating a canal way, putting the subway system back in or filling the tunnels entirely. The plan to fill the tunnels in completely has generated criticism as the cost of filling would not generate nor leverage economic development. 

Public support continues to grow for re-watering the original Erie Canal through downtown Rochester. [ citation needed ] In support of the re-watering efforts, the city released a master plan in 2009 calling for the creation of Rochester's Historic Canal District. A subsequent environmental review document is set to be released in the near future, seeking additional public input. This district includes both private and public investment that builds upon the rich heritage of the district, educational opportunities, historic interpretation, architectural significant building and recreational amenities. The city is currently seeking public funds for implementing the first of three major phases of the Canal District. Main Street looking east Major highways and roads [ edit ] 

There are three exits off the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 ) that serve Rochester. Rochester has an extensive system of limited-access highways (called 'freeways' and 'expressways') which connects all parts of the city and the Thruway. During the Thruway's construction, a disagreement between the governor of New York and mayor of Rochester resulted in a bypass of downtown Rochester, leaving the city struggling for growth. [ citation needed ] 

Rochester's expressway system, conceived in the 1950s, was designed as two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area and a lack of the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate an anticipated year-2000 metro population of 5 million, [ citation needed ] whereas the present-day population is just over one million. 

The Outer Loop circles just outside the city limits while the former Inner Loop once circled around the immediate downtown area within the city (the easternmost third was closed in 2015). From the west are Lake Ontario State Parkway , NY-531 and I-490 ; Interstate 390 feeds from the south; and NY-104 , NY-441 , and I-490 approach from the east. Later expressway proposals [ edit ] 

In the early 1970s, the Genesee Expressway Task Force, City leaders, and NYSDOT studied the feasibility of connecting the outer and inner Loops with a new southern expressway. The proposed route extended north from the I-390 and I-590 interchange in Brighton, cutting through Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood. In 1972, consultants Berger Lehman Associates recommended a new 'Busway', an expressway with dedicated bus lanes, similar to Bus Rapid Transit. [124] The expressway extension was never built. 

Three Interstate Highways run through the City of Rochester: 

Interstate 390 (Genesee Expressway) I-390 runs south-north, crossing I-90 (exit 46) and routing north through Rochester's western suburbs. Its northern end is at I-490 , however it continues north as NY-390 until it merges into the Lake Ontario State Parkway . South of I-90, I-390 runs to Avoca, New York , where it meets up with U.S. Route 15 and the Southern Tier Expressway, I-86 . 

Interstate 490 (Western/Eastern Expressway) I-490 runs west-east through Rochester, starting at Le Roy, New York and ending in Victor, New York . It interchanges with the two other Interstates in Rochester: I-390 at the western city limit and I-590 at the eastern limit, as well as connecting at both ends with the Thruway, I-90 (exits 47 and 45). In July 2007, a new bridge over the Genesee River was completed and named the Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge . 

Interstate 590 I-590 runs south-north through Rochester's eastern suburbs. Its southern end is at I-390 , while the northern end is at I-490 ; the highway continues north to the shore of Lake Ontario as NY-590 . In decreasing usage is the term " Can of Worms ", referring to the previously dangerous at-grade intersection of Interstate 490 and expressway NY-590 on the eastern edge of the Rochester city limits, bordering the suburb of Brighton . In the 1980s, a multimillion-dollar project created a system of overpasses and ramps that reduced the danger but resulted in the loss of certain exits. 

New York State Route Expressways: 

New York State Route 104 (Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway, West Ridge Road) NY 104 – Just east of the NY 590 interchange, NY 104 becomes the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay Bridge . On the other side of the Bay Bridge, in the town of Webster, NY 104 has exits before returning to an at-grade highway at Basket Road. 

New York State Route 390 NY 390 is an extension of Interstate 390 from the I-390/I-490 interchange in Gates. The northern terminus is at the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than a mile from the Lake Ontario shoreline. 

New York State Route 590 NY 590 is a limited-access extension of Interstate 590 at runs from an interchange between Interstate 490 and I-590 on the Brighton/Rochester border. The northern terminus is at Culver Road in Irondequoit, near Sea Breeze (the western shore of Irondequoit Bay at Lake Ontario). 

Inner Loop The Inner Loop encircles the downtown Rochester area. Unsigned reference New York State Route 940T begins and ends at Interstate 490, and the rest of the Loop is part of I-490 between exits 13 and 15, including the Frederick Douglass – Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge. This expressway is commonly used to define the borders of downtown Rochester. 

New York State Parkways : 

Lake Ontario State Parkway Lake Ontario State Parkway travels from Lakeside Beach State Park in Carlton, Orleans County. The eastern end is at Lake Avenue in the city of Rochester in Monroe County. Notable people [ edit ] See List of people from Rochester, New York 

Notable individuals who were born in and/or lived in Rochester include actress Kristen Wiig , Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte , and NHL ice hockey players Ryan Callahan and Brian Gionta . Sister cities [ edit ] 

Rochester has twelve sister cities , [125] as designated by Sister Cities International . They are all dedicated by a branched concrete walkway over the Genesee River, dubbed the Sister Cities Bridge (known as the Frank and Janet Lamb Bridge since October 2006): [126] Country City County / District / Region / State Date France Rennes Brittany 1958 [125] [127] Germany Würzburg Bavaria 1964 [125] [128] Italy Caltanissetta Sicily 1965 [125] Israel Rehovot Center District 1972 [125] Poland Kraków Małopolskie 1973 [125] [129] Mali Bamako Capital District 1975 [125] Country City County / District / Region / State Date Ireland Waterford County Waterford 1983 [125] Russia Novgorod Novgorod Oblast 1990 [125] Japan Hamamatsu Shizuoka Prefecture 1996 [125] [130] Dominican Republic Puerto Plata Puerto Plata province 1997 [125] China Xianyang Shaanxi 2007 [125] Lithuania Alytus Alytus County 2009 [125] See also [ edit ] New York portal Notes [ edit ] ^ Official records for Rochester kept January 1871 to September 1940 at downtown and at Greater Rochester Int'l since October 1940.

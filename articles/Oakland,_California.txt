Oakland / ˈ oʊ k l ə n d / is a city in and the county seat of Alameda County , California , United States . A major West Coast port city, Oakland is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area , the eighth-largest city in California, and the 45th-largest city in the country, with a population of 419,267 as of 2015 [update] . [14] It serves as a trade center for the San Francisco Bay Area ; its Port of Oakland is the busiest port for San Francisco Bay , all of Northern California , and fifth busiest in the United States. Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay . The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles (9.7 km) east of San Francisco . 

Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of California coastal terrace prairie , oak woodland , and north coastal scrub . Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad . Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile manufacturing industry. 

Oakland is known for its sustainability practices, including a top ranking for usage of electricity from renewable resources . Oakland is also known for its history of political activism, as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which include health care, dot-com companies and manufacturers of household products. In addition, due to a steady influx of immigrants during the 20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, Oakland is one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country.

History [ edit ] See also: History of Oakland, California and Timeline of Oakland, California Pre-incorporation [ edit ] 

The earliest known inhabitants were the Huchiun Indians, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone (a Miwok word meaning "western people"). [16] In Oakland, they were concentrated around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek , a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at Emeryville . 

In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was claimed, with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the King of Spain. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to Luis María Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio . The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain. [17] Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente. [18] The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called encinal —Spanish for "oak grove"—due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which eventually led to the city's name. [19] City beginnings [ edit ] 1857 Map of Oakland 

In 1851, three men— Horace Carpentier , Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland. On May 4, 1852, the Town of Oakland incorporated. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland, with Horace Carpentier elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year. The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today's Port of Oakland . 

A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis "Borax" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System , the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit . 1900–1950s [ edit ] One day's output of 1917 Chevrolet automobiles at their major West Coast plant, now the location of Eastmont Town Center 

At the time of incorporation, Oakland consisted of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of Alameda being made an island. In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. 

In 1916, General Motors opened a major automobile factory in East Oakland called Oakland Assembly . It produced Chevrolet cars and then GMC trucks until 1963, when it was moved to Fremont in southern Alameda County. [20] Also in 1916, the Fageol Motor Company chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming tractors from 1918 to 1923. [21] [22] By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous manufacturing industries, including metals , canneries, bakeries, internal combustion engines , automobiles, and shipbuilding. [23] By 1929, when Chrysler expanded with a new plant there, Oakland had become known as the " Detroit of the West," referring to the major auto manufacturing center in Michigan. [24] 

Oakland expanded during the 1920s, as its population expanded with factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built in the 3 years between 1921 and 1924, [25] more than during the 13 years between 1907 and 1920. [26] Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; they reflect the architectural styles of the time. In 1924, the Tribune Tower was completed; in 1976, it was restored and declared an Oakland landmark. It is no longer used by the Oakland Tribune. 

Russell Clifford Durant established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street in 1916. [27] The first transcontinental airmail flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, flown by Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta . [28] Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles (6.4 km) to the southwest. [29] 

During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100 million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company. [30] 

President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers were attracted from around the country, and especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee. Henry J. Kaiser 's representatives recruited sharecroppers and tenant farmers from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the Great Migration by which a total of five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, in the years from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the Jim Crow South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for the better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony that Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated. [31] Also migrating to the area during this time were many Mexican Americans from southwestern states such as New Mexico , Texas , and Colorado . Many worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad , at its major rail yard in West Oakland. Their young men encountered hostility and discrimination by Armed Forces personnel, and tensions broke out in " zoot suit riots " in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of a major disturbance in Los Angeles that year. [32] View of Lake Merritt looking southwest from the northeastern tip of the lake 

In 1946 National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company , acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland's electric streetcar system. The city's expensive electric streetcar fleet was converted to the cheaper diesel buses. [33] The state Legislature created the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District in 1955, which operates today as AC Transit , the third-largest bus-only transit system in the nation. [34] 

Soon after the war, as Oakland's shipbuilding industry declined and the automobile industry went through restructuring, many jobs were lost. Economic competition increased racial tension. [35] In addition, labor unrest increased as workers struggled to protect their livelihoods. Oakland was the center of a general strike during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country that had such a strike after World War II. [36] 1960–1999 [ edit ] 

In 1960, Kaiser Corporation erected its headquarters; it was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as "the largest office tower west of Chicago " up to that time. [37] In the postwar period, suburban development increased around Oakland, and wealthier residents moved to new housing. Despite the major increases in the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality before the law. Police abuse of blacks was common. [38] [39] 

Students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party at Merritt College to emphasize black power and taking care of their own community. Among their social programs were feeding children and providing other services to the needy. During the 1970s, Oakland began to suffer serious violence and other problems related to gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale operation of this kind. [35] Both violent crime and property crime increased during this period, and Oakland's murder rate rose to twice that of San Francisco or New York City. [35] 

As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden cities. [40] 

In 1980 Oakland's black population reached its 20th-century peak at approximately 47% of the overall city population. 

The 6.9 Mw Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989. The rupture was related to the San Andreas fault system and affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ). Many structures in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker portion of Interstate 880 that collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month. 

On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm swept down from the Berkeley /Oakland hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and an estimated economic loss of US$ 1.5 billion, this was the worst urban firestorm in American history. [41] [42] 

During the mid-1990s, Oakland's economy began to recover as it transitioned to new types of jobs. In addition, the city participated in large development and urban renewal projects, concentrated especially in the downtown area, at the Port of Oakland, and at the Oakland International Airport. [43] 2000s [ edit ] Oak Tree growing in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza 

After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan. [44] Brown's plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification , which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities. [45] The economic crises in 2001 and 2008 hampered Oakland's recovery as these downturns resulted in lowered sales, rentals and occupancy of the new housing, and slower growth and economic recovery than expected. 

Due to allegations of misconduct by the Oakland Police Department , the City of Oakland has paid claims for a total of US$ 57 million during the 2001–2011 timeframe to plaintiffs claiming police abuse; this is the largest sum paid by any city in California. [46] On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began " Occupy Oakland " demonstrations at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland . [47] [48] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of center of Oakland 

Oakland is on the east side of San Francisco Bay . In 1991 the City Hall tower was at 37°48′19″N 122°16′21″W ﻿ / ﻿ 37.805302°N 122.272539°W ﻿ / 37.805302; -122.272539 (NAD83). (The building still exists, but like the rest of the Bay Area it has shifted northwest perhaps 0.6 meters in the last twenty years.) 

The United States Census Bureau says the city's total area is 78.0 square miles (202 km 2 ), including 55.8 square miles (145 km 2 ) of land and 22.2 square miles (57 km 2 ) (28.48 percent) of water. 

Oakland's highest point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over 1,760 feet (540 m) above sea level at about 37°52′43″N 122°13′27″W ﻿ / ﻿ 37.8786°N 122.2241°W ﻿ / 37.8786; -122.2241 . Oakland has 19 miles (31 km) of shoreline, [49] but Radio Beach is the only beach in Oakland. 

Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as "the flatlands" and "the hills" . Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range. 

Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas fault caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities. [50] Cityscape [ edit ] Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: List of neighborhoods in Oakland, California The north end of the Adams Point district, as seen from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of the Lake Upper Rockridge in Oakland, California. 

Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The greater divisions in the city include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District , Lake Merritt , East Oakland , North Oakland , West Oakland , and the Oakland Hills . East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point , and encompassing the Port of Oakland . In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most walkable city in the United States. [51] 

Lake Merritt, an urban estuary near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable features. [52] It was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge in 1870. [53] Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake . Lake Merritt, towards the southern end 

The city of Piedmont , incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland. Climate and vegetation [ edit ] 

Oakland has a Mediterranean climate with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt , a large estuary centrally located east of Downtown, was designated as the United States' first official wildlife refuge. 

Based on data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities. [54] Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are mild and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose , making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the Bay Bridge means that the Northern part of the city can have cooling maritime fog . It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from Berkeley . 

The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was 104 °F (40 °C) on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was 24 °F (−4 °C) on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with 38.65 inches (982 mm) and the driest year was 1910 with 12.02 inches (305 mm). The most rainfall in one month was 15.35 inches (390 mm) in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 4.27 inches (108 mm) on February 12, 1904. [55] Rainfall near the bayfront is only 23 inches (580 mm), but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to 30 inches [760 mm]). 

The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. Australian eucalyptus trees have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate. 

The National Weather Service today has two official weather stations in Oakland: Oakland International Airport and the Oakland Museum (established 1970). Climate data for Oakland Museum (1981–2010 normals) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 78

Shifting of cultures [ edit ] 

Oakland is one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. [74] [75] Oakland was ranked the fourth most diverse city in America, with an overall diversity score of 91.4. [76] The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990, due to a combination of factors, such as suburbanization. Oakland became a destination for African Americans in the Great Migration during and after World War II as they gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Since the 1960s, Oakland has been known as a center of Northern California's African-American community. 

Between 2000 and 2010 Oakland's black population decreased by nearly 25 percent. [77] The city's demographics have changed due to a combination of rising housing prices associated with gentrification and with blacks relocating to better housing in Bay Area suburbs or moving to the Southern United States in a reverse migration, where conditions are considered to have improved. [78] [79] [80] Blacks have formed a strong plurality in Oakland for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population. 

In the 2010 census African Americans maintained their status as Oakland's single largest ethnic group, with 27% of the population, followed by non-Hispanic whites at 25.9%, and Hispanics of any race at 25.4%. [81] Ethnic Asians constitute 17%, followed by smaller minority groups. 

Recent trends and cultural shifts have led to a decline among some of Oakland's longstanding black institutions, such as churches, businesses and nightclubs, which had developed during the growing years of the 1950s through 1970. [82] Some long-time black residents have been dismayed at the population changes. [77] There have also been incidents of racial profiling by newer residents on social networking sites such as Nextdoor.com . [83] 

Many immigrants have settled in the city. In recent years, immigrants and others have marched by the thousands down Oakland's International Boulevard in support of legal reforms benefiting illegal immigrants . [84] 

An analysis by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census 2000 numbers showed that Oakland had the third-highest concentration of gays and lesbians among the 50 largest U.S. cities, behind San Francisco and Seattle. Census data showed that, among incorporated places that have at least 500 female couples, Oakland had the nation's largest proportion. In the 2000 census, 2,650 lesbian couples identified as such in Oakland; one in every 41 Oakland couples identified as a same-sex female partnership.

Oakland is a major West Coast port, and the fifth busiest in the United States by cargo volume. [87] The Port of Oakland handles 99% of all containerized goods moving through Northern California, representing $41 billion worth of international trade. [88] [89] There are nearly 200,000 jobs related to marine cargo transport in the Oakland area. [90] These jobs range from minimum wage hourly positions to Transportation Storage and Distribution Managers who earn an annual average salary of US$ 91,520. [91] The Port of Oakland was an early innovator/pioneer in the technologies of Intermodal Containerized Shipping . The city is also home to several major corporations including Kaiser Permanente , Clorox , and Dreyer's ice cream, and retailer Cost Plus World Markets . [92] Tech companies such as Ask.com and Pandora Radio are located in Oakland, [93] and in recent years many start-up high tech and green energy companies have found a home in the downtown neighborhoods of Uptown, City Center, Jack London Square and Lake Merritt Financial District. [94] In 2014, Oakland was the fifth ranked city for tech entrepreneurs by total venture capital investment. [95] 

As of 2013 [update] , the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area has a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of US$ 360.4 billion, ranking eighth among metropolitan areas in the United States. [96] In 2014, Oakland was amongst the best cities to start a career, the highest ranked city in California after San Francisco. Additionally, Oakland ranked fourth in cities with professional opportunities. [97] Numerous companies in San Francisco continue to expand in or migrate over to Oakland. [98] 

Oakland experienced an increase of both its population and of land values in the early-to-mid first decade of the 21st century. The 10k Plan , which began during former mayor Elihu Harris ' administration, and intensified during former mayor Jerry Brown's administration resulted in several thousand units of new multi-family housing and development. Top employers [ edit ]

Occupancy is 74%, while RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) increased by 14%, the highest increase of any big city in the western region of the United States. [101] Both Oakland and San Francisco were forecasted to experience the highest increases in ADR ( Average daily rate ). [102] 

In recent years, Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination. In 2012, Oakland was named the top North American city to visit, highlighting its growing number of sophisticated restaurants and bars, top music venues, and increasing nightlife appeal. [103] Oakland also took the No. 16 spot in "America's Coolest Cities," ranked by metrics like entertainment options and recreational opportunities per capita, etc. [104] In 2013, Oakland topped the No. 1 spot in "America's Most Exciting Cities," notably having the most movie theaters, theater companies, and museums per square mile. [105] In "America's Most Hipster Cities," Oakland took the number-5 spot, cited for luring San Francisco "hippies" into the city. [106] Oakland has also increased its travel destination allure internationally. [107] Arts and culture [ edit ] 

Oakland has a significant art scene and claims the highest concentration of artists per capita in the United States. [108] In 2013, Oakland was designated as one of America's top twelve art communities, recognizing Downtown (including Uptown), Chinatown, Old Oakland, and Jack London Square as communities "that have most successfully combined art, artists and venues for creativity and expression with independent businesses, retail shops and restaurants, and a walkable lifestyle to make vibrant neighborhoods." [109] Galleries exist in various parts of Oakland, with the newest additions centered mostly in the Uptown area. Oakland ranked 11th in cities for designers and artists. [110] The city is a renowned culinary hotbed,offering both a wide variety and innovative approaches cuisine in restaurants and markets, often featuring locally grown produce and international foods such as French, Italian, Iberian, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, African-Caribbean, Southern/French African-Americanan fusion, etc. that reflect the city's ethnically diverse population. Historically a focal point of the West Coast blues and jazz scenes, Oakland is also home to musicians representing such genres as rhythm and blues , gospel , funk , punk , heavy metal , Rap / Gangsta rap , and hip hop .

The Paramount Theater features headlining musical tours and productions, while Fox Oakland Theatre draws various musical genres including jam bands , rock, punk, blues, jazz, and reggae. The Paramount and Fox theaters often book simultaneous events, creating busy nights uptown. [111] In 2012, Oakland was dubbed a "New Sin City", following its 2010 decision to relax its cabaret laws, which gave a boost to its nightclub and bar scene. [112] 

Recent years have seen the growth of the Oakland Art Murmur event, occurring in the Uptown neighborhood the first Friday evening of every month. [113] The event attracts around 20,000 people along twenty city blocks, featuring live performances, food trucks, and over 30 galleries and venues. [114] [115] "There is no there there" [ edit ] The HERETHERE sculpture straddling the Oakland- Berkeley border 

Gertrude Stein wrote about Oakland in her 1937 book Everybody's Autobiography : "There is no there there," Stein wrote on learning that the neighborhood where she lived as a child had been torn down to make way for an industrial park . The quote is sometimes misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole. [116] [117] 

Modern-day Oakland has turned the quote on its head, with a statue downtown titled "There." In 2005 a sculpture called HERETHERE was installed by the City of Berkeley on the Berkeley-Oakland border at Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The sculpture consists of eight-foot-tall letters spelling "HERE" and "THERE" in front of the BART tracks as they descend from their elevated section in Oakland to the subway through Berkeley . [118] Professional sports [ edit ] 

Oakland has teams in three professional sports: Baseball, basketball, and football. The Oakland Athletics MLB club won three consecutive World Series championships in 1972 , 1973 , and 1974 , and appeared in another three consecutive World Series from 1988 to 1990, winning their fourth championship in 1989 . The Golden State Warriors won the 1974–1975 NBA championship and the 2014–2015 NBA championship . The Oakland Raiders of the NFL won Super Bowl XI in 1977 and Super Bowl XV in 1981, while also appearing in Super Bowl II in 1968 and Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. The Raiders left Oakland for Los Angeles in 1982, where they won a third Super Bowl championship, and returned to Oakland in 1995. The Warriors announced in April 2014 that they will leave Oakland once their new arena is built across the Bay in San Francisco, while the Raiders are in discussion with city officials about building a new football-only stadium.

Parks and recreation [ edit ] J. Mora Moss House in Mosswood Park was built in 1864 by San Francisco businessman Joseph Moravia Moss in the Carpenter Gothic style. The building houses Parks and Recreation offices and storage. Parks [ edit ] 

Oakland has many parks and recreation centers which total 5,937 acres (2,403 ha). In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land , a national land conservation organization, reported that Oakland had the 18th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. [119] In 2013, Oakland ranked 4th among American cities as an urban destination for nature lovers. [120] 

Some of the city's most notable parks include: Joaquin Miller Park Joseph Knowland State Arboretum and Park , home of the Oakland Zoo Lake Merritt Morcom Rose Garden best from July through October Mosswood Park Peralta Hacienda Historical Park, [121] headquarters of the Peralta rancho, Rancho San Antonio William Joseph McInnes Botanic Garden and Campus Arboretum , located on the Mills College campus

Law and government [ edit ] See also: Government of Alameda County, California Oakland City Hall and central plaza in 1917. Built of framed steel with unreinforced masonry infill at a cost of US$ 2 million in 1914, the structure was the tallest building in Oakland until the Tribune Tower was built in 1923. 

Oakland has a mayor-council government . The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The Oakland City Council has eight council members representing seven districts in Oakland with one member elected at-large and others from single-member districts ; council members serve staggered four-year terms. The mayor appoints a city administrator, subject to the confirmation by the City Council, who is the chief administrative officer of the city. Other city officers include: city attorney (elected), city auditor (elected), and city clerk (appointed by city administrator). [122] Oakland's mayor is limited to two terms. There are no term limits for the city council. Council member Larry Reid, also serving as vice-mayor, was elected to a fifth term in November 2012. [123] 

Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake until US$ 80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was complete in 1995. [124] City offices had to be housed in leased space and other locations. 

Jean Quan was elected mayor in November 2010, beating Don Perata and Rebecca Kaplan in the city's first ranked choice balloting . [125] This new system is intended to increase voters' ability to choose preferred candidates, as they can combine ranked votes when several candidates are competing. 

Oakland is also part of Alameda County , for which the Government of Alameda County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution , California law , and the Charter of the County of Alameda. [126] The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. The County government is primarily composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors , other elected offices including the Sheriff /Coroner, the District Attorney , Assessor , Auditor-Controller/County Clerk/Recorder , and Treasurer/Tax Collector , and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator.

[9] In the United States House of Representatives , Oakland is in California's 13th congressional district , represented by Democrat Barbara Lee . [10] Politics [ edit ] Oakland City Hall near City Center 

Oakland was politically conservative from the 1860s to the 1950s, with positions expressed by the Republican-oriented Oakland Tribune newspaper. At the time, the Republican Party was more moderate than it has become in the 21st century, and some members belonged to a progressive tradition across the Northern Tier of states. In the 1950s and '60s, the majority of voters began to favor liberal policies and the Democratic Party. [127] [128] Oakland has the highest percentage of registered Democrats of any of the incorporated cities in Alameda County, with Berkeley coming in a close second. As of 2009 [update] , Oakland has 204,646 registered voters. 140,858 (68.8%) are registered Democrats, 12,248 (5.9%) are registered Republicans, 10,431 (5.2%) are members of other parties and 41,109 (20.1%) decline to state a political affiliation. [129] Oakland is widely regarded as being one of the most liberal major cities in the nation. The Cook Partisan Voting Index of Congressional District 13 , which includes Oakland and Berkeley, is D+37, making it the most Democratic congressional district in California and the fourth most Democratic district in the US. [130] Crime [ edit ] Main article: Crime in Oakland, California 

While progress has been made in reducing the city's historically high property crime rate, violent crime has remained a persistent problem in Oakland, primarily concentrated in certain poor minority neighborhoods. There were 93 homicides in 2015, seven more than in 2014. [131] 

Oakland's crime rate began to escalate during the late 1960s, and by the end of the 1970s, during the drug wars, the city's per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of San Francisco or New York City. [132] The rise in crime may have been an effect of the different method that was used to deal with rebellious youth. Prior to 1960, there were successful government funded social programs, where workers would work in neighborhoods searching for rebellious teens to enter them in youth centers that would be able to teach them proper values and improve their behavior. [133] 

But by the late 1960s, the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used military tactics to manage unwanted behavior, with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment. [133] During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States, [134] but in the latter part of the decade, the homicide rate dropped four years in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%. During 2011 there were increases in both categories. [135] In 2012 Oakland reported 131 homicides, the highest since 2006 (when there were 148 recorded). [136] [137] 

Since then there have been continued decreases: In 2013, there was a 33% decrease in homicides, allowing Oakland to record its lowest homicide count since 2004. Aggravated assaults were down 10% and rapes declined by 27%, reaching its lowest level in eight years. [138] [139] In the first quarter of 2014, homicides, aggravated assaults, and burglaries were down 15% relative to 2013. Additionally, shootings were down 31% and robberies were down 36%. [140] 

Oakland's police force has dropped to 612 officers, down from more than 800 in 2009. It is below the 925 recommended by the city's strategic plan. The city has recently started to rebuild its force and recently graduated 34 officers. [136] The Oakland Police Department is committed to improved public safety by increasing police presence during peak crime hours, improving intelligence gathering, and moving more aggressively to arrest violent crime suspects. [141] [142] 

Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, although these districts have 44% of Oakland's residents. [143] 

In 2012, Oakland implemented Operation Ceasefire , a gang violence reduction plan used in other cities, based in part on the research and strategies of author David M. Kennedy . [144] [145] [146] [147] Education [ edit ] Primary and secondary education [ edit ] 

Most public schools in Oakland are operated by the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), which covers the city except for Sheffield Village. Due to financial troubles and administrative failures, it was in receivership by the state of California from 2002 to 2008. [148] As of 2015 [update] the Oakland Unified School District includes 86 division-run schools and 32 charter schools; the district also manages several adult education programs. As of 2015 [update] there are 48,181 total K–12 students; among division-run schools, there are 4,600 plus employees. [149] 

OUSD test scores historically lag behind the rest of California, in particular due to a high proportion of English-language learners. [150] Some individual schools have much better performance than the citywide average. As of 2013 [update] , for example, over half the students at Hillcrest Elementary School in the Montclair upper hills neighborhood performed at the "advanced" level in the English portion of the test, and students at Lincoln Elementary School in the Chinatown neighborhood performed at the "advanced" level in the math portion. [151] 

Oakland's three largest public high schools are Oakland High School , Oakland Technical High School , and Skyline High School . There are also numerous small public high schools within Castlemont Community of Small Schools , Fremont Federation of High Schools , and McClymonds Educational Complex , all of which were once single, larger public high schools that were reorganized due to poor performance (Castlemont High School, Fremont High School, and McClymonds High School , respectively). 

Among charter schools in the district, North Oakland Community Charter School (NOCCS), an elementary and middle school, is one of the few public progressive schools in the country. [ clarification needed ] Other charter schools include the Oakland Military Institute , Oakland School for the Arts , Bay Area Technology School , and Oakland Charter Academy. [152] 

There are several private high schools including the secular The College Preparatory School and Head-Royce School , and the Catholic Bishop O'Dowd High School , Holy Names High School and St. Elizabeth High School . Catholic schools in Oakland are operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland also include eight K–8 schools (plus one in Piedmont on the Oakland city border). Northern Light School is a private nonprofit elementary and middle school. Bentley School is an Independent Co-educational K–12, college preparatory school, located on two campuses in Oakland and Lafayette, California. Colleges and universities [ edit ]

In 2001, the SFSU Oakland Multimedia Center was opened, allowing San Francisco State University to conduct classes near downtown Oakland. [153] The Oakland Higher Education Consortium and the City of Oakland's Community and Economic Development Agency (CEDA) opened the Oakland Higher Education Center downtown in 2002 to provide "access to multiple higher education service providers within a shared urban facility." Member schools include primary user California State University, East Bay as well as Lincoln University, New College of California , Saint Mary's College of California , SFSU Multimedia Studies Program, UC Berkeley Extension, University of Phoenix and Peralta Community College District. [154] [155] Media [ edit ] Main article: List of television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area 

Oakland is served by major television stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The region's Fox O O , KTVU , is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at Jack London Square along with co-owned independent station KICU-TV (licensed to San Jose). In addition, the city is served by various AM and FM radio stations as well; AM stations KKSF , KMKY , KNEW and KQKE are licensed to Oakland. 

Oakland is served by the Oakland Tribune , which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The Tribune Tower , which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00 am, noon and 5:00 pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011. [156] 

The East Bay Express , a locally owned free weekly paper, is based in Jack London Square and distributed throughout the East Bay. 

Oaklandwiki is a thriving (mostly) English-language LocalWiki . Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] Air and rail [ edit ] 

Oakland residents have access to the three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: Oakland International Airport , San Francisco International Airport , and San Jose International Airport . Oakland International Airport, located within the city limits of Oakland, is 4 mi (6.4 km) south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic and international destinations. AC Transit provides 24-hour service to the airport, and the Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line automated guideway transit provides frequent service between the airport and BART's Oakland Coliseum Station . 

The city has regional and long distance passenger train service provided by Amtrak , with stations located near Jack London Square and the Oakland Coliseum . Amtrak's California Zephyr has its western terminus at the nearby Emeryville station . 

Historically, the city was served by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. Santa Fe trains terminated at the 40th and San Pablo station. Southern Pacific trains ended at the 16th Street Station . [157] Western Pacific trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at Oakland Pier . [158] From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco . Mass transit and bicycling [ edit ] The Lake Merritt BART station . 

The most recent census data compiled in 2007 before gasoline price spikes in 2008, show 24.3 percent of Oaklanders used public transportation, walked or used "other means" to commute to work, not including telecommuting , [159] with 17 percent of Oakland households being "car free" and or statistically categorized as having "no vehicles available." [160] 

Bus transit service in Oakland and the inner East Bay is provided by the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District, AC Transit . The district originated in 1958 after the conspiratorial dissolution of the Key System of streetcars. Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System. [34] 

Intercity bus companies that serve Oakland include Greyhound , BoltBus , Megabus , USAsia , and Hoang Transportation . [161] 

The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland. The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations. BART's headquarters was located in a building above the Lake Merritt BART station until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic safety concerns. 

The Alameda / Oakland Ferry operates ferry service from Jack London Square to Alameda , San Francisco, and Angel Island . Oakland licenses taxi cabs, and has zoned cab stands in its downtown, including a bicycle pedi-cab service. 

The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) element of Oakland's 1998 General Plan. In addition, the Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005 and 2007. Several miles of bike lanes were created as a result of the plan, with more awaiting funding. [ citation needed ] Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland. [ citation needed ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey, Oakland moved into 7th place in the nation by percentage of people that choose to commute by bike in 2011. [162] Bridges, freeways, and tunnels [ edit ] 

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the MacArthur Maze freeway interchange: Interstate 580 (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward Hayward and eventually to the California Central Valley ; Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to San Jose ; and the Eastshore Freeway ( Interstate 80 /I-580) runs north, providing connections to Sacramento and San Rafael , respectively. Interstate 980 (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into State Route 24 (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. State Route 13 begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the Montclair District before entering Berkeley . A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned. Portion of the collapsed Cypress Viaduct in Oakland. 

At the time of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span. 

Two underwater tunnels, the Webster and Posey Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the Park Street , Fruitvale , and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the Oakland Estuary . 

In the hills, the Leimert Bridge crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The Caldecott Tunnel carries Highway 24 through the Berkeley Hills , connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores. Freight rail [ edit ] 

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and to a lesser extent by BNSF Railway (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland). 

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the Western Pacific Railroad (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the Sacramento Northern Railroad (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983). Shipping [ edit ] 

As one of the three major ports on the West Coast of the United States , the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer , [163] thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco , which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e. facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes. [ citation needed ] Utilities [ edit ] 

Water and sewage treatment are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG E) provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to Waste Management, Inc . Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 . 

Oakland tops the list of the 50 largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources. [164] Healthcare [ edit ] 

Originating in Oakland, Kaiser Permanente , is an HMO started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser to provide medical care for Kaiser Shipyards workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world. [165] It is headquartered at 1950 Franklin Street in Downtown Oakland and maintains a large medical center in the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood. 

Alta Bates Summit Medical Center , an East Bay hospital system, maintains its Summit Campus in the neighborhood known as "Pill Hill" north of downtown. Until 2000, it was the Summit Medical Center before merging with Berkeley-based Alta Bates. All campuses now operate under the Sutter Health network. 

Alameda County Medical Center is operated by the county and provides medical services to county residents, including the medically indigent who do not have health insurance . The main campus, Highland Hospital in East Oakland, is the trauma center for the northern area of the East Bay . 

Children's Hospital Oakland is the primary medical center specializing in pediatrics in the East Bay. It is a designated Level I pediatric trauma center, and the only independent children's hospital in Northern California.

Shippers brought produce from all over California for canning at several large plants—including the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which developed the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company, which took over the H. G. Prince Company between 1925 and 1930. In 1943, the Oakland Tribune reported that the $100,000,000 canning industry in Oakland ranked second only to shipbuilding in value. ^ Zinko, Carolyne (September 26, 2007).

History [ edit ] Arusha clock tower area, 1953. 

The current site of Arusha was first settled in the 1830s by the agro-pastoral Arusha Maasai from the Arusha Chini community, south of Mount Kilimanjaro . [2] :page 112 They traded grains, honey, beer, and tobacco with the pastoral Kisongo Maasai in exchange for livestock, milk, meat, and skins. [2] :page 112 Demand for Arusha's foodstuffs increased substantially during the 1860s when the Pangani Valley trade route was extended through Old Moshi, Arusha, and ultimately to western Kenya. [2] :page 112 Although it was not yet a town, it was a regional centre and had a number of urban features. [2] :page 113 

Arusha was conquered by the Germans in 1896 after the murder of the first two missionaries who attempted to settle on nearby Mount Meru . [2] :page 113 The Germans established a permanent presence in 1900 when a military fort (a boma ) was built and soldiers were garrisoned there. [2] :page 113 "The boma was a solid statement, meant to impress German moral and political order on the surrounding countryside. Set on a rise overlooking the plains, the fortress-like building dominated the surrounding landscape" complete with a machine gun. [2] :page 113 Many Africans were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands by the Germans and forced to dig lime or carry stones to construct the fort. [2] :page 114 

The British took Arusha from the Germans in 1916 during World War I . [2] :page 114 German officials left the area, the British deported German missionaries and settlers, and only a skeletal military administration of the town remained. [2] :page 114 But slowly during the 1920s, civilian administration was implemented, missionaries from the United States arrived, British and Greek settlers reoccupied the former German farms, and the town grew, especially after the British moved the regional administration from New Moshi to Arusha. [2] :page 114 The extension of the railroad from Moshi to Arusha in 1928-29 greatly increased commerce. [2] :page 114 The Great Depression soon thereafter, however, squelched commerce, and Arusha in 1940 had less than 2,000 residents. [2] :page 115 Growth resumed during World War II and by 1948, the population had increased to more than 5,000. [2] :page 115 

In the 1960s parts of the movie Hatari! with John Wayne were filmed at Momella. 

Arusha has been a crucial city in the history of modern Tanzania. Official documents ceding independence to Tanganyika were signed by the United Kingdom at Arusha in 1961. Also, the Arusha Declaration was signed in 1967 in Arusha.

The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi was signed on 28 August 2000 as part of a process forging peace in that country through power sharing and establishing a transitional government. The January 2015 Arusha Agreement for South Sudan created a framework for the reunification of South Sudan's ruling SPLM party, which had splintered into three creating a humanitarian crisis as fighting between factions intensified. It provided that all SPLM members who were dismissed be reinstated to their previous positions and a secret ballot system be adopted. [3] Arusha Declaration Monument in Arusha 

In 1994 the UN Security Council decided by its Resolution 955 of 8 November 1994 that Arusha should host the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda . The establishment of the tribunal with its foreign employees has influenced the local economy of the city increasing the cost of living for residents. The tribunal has downsized due to its closure in 2014, but its legal successor, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1966 , will continue entertaining a branch in Arusha, opening on 1 July 2012.

It has distinct wet and dry seasons, and experiences an eastern prevailing wind from the Indian Ocean , a couple of hundred miles east. Under the Köppen climate classification system, it has a temperate highland tropical climate with dry winters (Cwb). Areas to the south and west of Arusha away are classified as tropical savanna climates (Aw).

The record [7] high since records began in 2000 is 39 degrees Celsius (102 F). Record low is 7 Celsius (45 F). Arusha averages 29.8 days per year above 32 Celsius (90F) – all between November and March. Arusha's annual precipitation average is 123 cm (48.7 inches), mostly coming during the long rainy season from March to May. Areas immediately to the north and northeast of Arusha can see more precipitation and cooler temperatures due to the influence of Mt. Meru, whose rain shadow extends toward the southeast side of the mountain. 

Arusha and the northern highlands of Tanzania experience a bimodal rainfall pattern, with two rainy seasons. Many crops are planted twice per year. The long "masika" rains from March through May are more reliable in Arusha than in surrounding areas because of the influence of Mt. Meru. The short "vuli" rains are less reliable, usually coming in November and December. The dry "kiangazi" season is June to October. Higher elevation areas north and northeast of the city are home to farmers growing bananas, coffee, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, leafy greens, and other vegetables. Cultivation in areas to the northwest, west, southwest, south, and southeast focuses on maize, beans and wheat. There is a significant horticulture industry, with several companies growing flowers for export to Europe. Sports [ edit ] Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium .

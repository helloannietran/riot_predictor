History [ edit ] 

The town of Zhanaozen was founded in 1964, after the opening of an oil field in Uzen. On 21 October 1968 Novy Uzen took the status of a settlement of town type, and since March 20, 1973 the status of a city of regional significance. June 1989 saw large disorders. Novy Uzen was renamed Zhanaozen in October 1993. 2011 oil strike [ edit ] Main article: 2011 Mangystau riots 

In May 2011, workers from the Ozenmunaigas oil field went on strike over pay. The strike was declared illegal by local courts and the state oil company sacked nearly 1000 employees. [4] Some of the sacked workers then occupied the town square in protest. On 16 December 2011 police were accused of firing on them. [5] Fifteen people (workers and police officers) were killed according to government officials, though opposition sources put the death toll in the dozens. [6] In disturbances that day local government offices, a hotel and an office of the state oil company were set on fire, according to General Prosecutor Askhat Daulbayev . [5] Eighty-six people were injured in the clashes – according to the authorities – and due to shortage of hospital beds in Zhanaozen, many were taken to be treated in the regional capital Aktau , about 150 km away. [6] 

A state of emergency was declared on December 17, roads into Zhanaozen were blocked, and the local airport was closed for incoming flights. Mobile phone coverage was blocked, as were internet connections. [6] Trials and allegations of torture and abuse [ edit ] 

A trial of protesters began in Aktau in May 2012. Many defendants complained that they had been physically abused, and some even tortured, while in police custody and during interrogation. [4] Some witnesses also claimed they had been threatened by police into giving false testimony. [4]

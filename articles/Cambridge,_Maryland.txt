History [ edit ] Cambridge Municipal Building 

Settled by English colonists in 1684, Cambridge is one of the oldest colonial cities in Maryland. [7] At the time of English colonization, the Algonquian -speaking Choptank Indians were already living along the river of the same name. During the colonial years, the English colonists developed farming on the Eastern Shore. The largest plantations were devoted first to tobacco, and then mixed farming. Planters bought enslaved Africans to farm tobacco and mixed farming. The town was a trading center for the area. The town pier was the center for slave trading for the region, a sad history documented well in historical markers throughout the town center. It was incorporated officially in 1793, [8] and occupies part of the former Choptank Indian Reservation. [9] Cambridge was named after the town and county in England. [10] The town became a stop on the underground railroad, which had an extensive network of safe houses for slaves escaping to the north. 

Cambridge developed food processing industries in the late 19th century, canning oysters , tomatoes and sweet potatoes . Industrial growth in Cambridge was led by the Phillips Packing Company, which eventually grew to become the area's largest employer. The company won contracts with the Department of Defense during the First and Second World wars that aided its growth. At its peak, it employed as many as 10,000 workers. [11] Changing tastes brought about a decline in business leading Phillips to downsize its operations. By the early 1960s the company ceased operations altogether. This led to widescale unemployment and added to the city's growing social problems. [12] 

During the period from 1962 until 1967, Cambridge was a center of Civil Rights Movement protests as blacks sought access to work and housing. They also wanted to end racial segregation of schools and other public facilities. Race-related violence erupted in Cambridge in 1963 and 1967 , and forces of the Maryland National Guard were assigned to the city to assist local authorities with peace-keeping efforts. [13] The leader of the movement was Gloria Richardson . With the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, public segregation in Cambridge officially ended. 

In 2002, the city's economy was boosted by jobs and tourism associated with the opening of the 400-room Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay resort. This resort includes a golf course , spa , and marina . The resort was the site of the 2007 US House Republican Conference , which included an address by U.S. President George W. Bush . [14] 

Cambridge was designated a Maryland Main Street community on July 1, 2003. Cambridge Main Street is a comprehensive downtown revitalization process created by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. It plans to strengthen the economic potential of select cities around the state. The initiative has led to enhancements of its heritage tourism attractions. Together with other cities on the Eastern Shore, Cambridge is attracting more tourists. It has revitalized its downtown business district, part of which was designated a historical district in 1990. [15] 

Four different teams in the old Eastern Shore Baseball League —the Canners, Cardinals, Clippers, and Dodgers—were located in Cambridge.

History [ edit ] Main article: Bharatpur State Coat of arms of Bharatpur rulers 

The rulers of Bharatpur were from the Sinsinwar clan of which is an indo-sythian tribe that migrated in India around AD100. According to Cunningham and William Cook, the city of Gohad was founded in 1505 by the Bamraulia village, who had been forced to leave Bamraulia by a satrap of Firuz Shah Tughluq . A notorious tribe dug up Akbar's tomb at Sikandra and the Rajputs cremated him asin Hindu tradition. Gohad developed into an important Jat state, and was later captured by the Marathas . The Ranas of Gohad signed a treaty with the British and helped them capture Gwalior and Gohad from the Marathas. The British kept Gwalior and handed control of Gohad to the Jats in 1804. However, Gohad was handed over to the Marathas under a revised treaty dated 22 November 1805 between the Marathas and the British. As compensation for Gohad, the Jat ruler, Rana Kirat Singh, was given Dhaulpur , Badi and Rajakheda. Kirat Singh moved to Dhaulpur in December 1805.

In the 10th century, the Yadav people took control of Dhaulpur, which had been ruled by the Rajputs . Dhaulpur was taken by Sikandar Lodhi in 1501, who handed it to a Muslim governor in 1504. In 1527, Dhaulpur fort fell to Babur and continued to be ruled by the Mughals until 1707. After the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb , Raja Kalyan Singh Bhadauria obtained possession of Dhaulpur, and his family retained it until 1761. After that, Dholpur was taken successively by the Jat ruler Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur; by Mirza Najaf Khan in 1775; by the Scindia ruler of Gwalior in 1782; and finally, by the British East India Company in 1803. It was restored by the British to the Scindias under the Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon, briefly, and was soon reoccupied by the British. In 1805, Dhaulpur came under the Jat ruler, Kirat Singh of Gohad, a princely state , a vassal of the British during the Raj.

Being a UNESCO World Heritage Site , the duck-hunting reserve of the Maharajas is one of the major wintering areas for large numbers of aquatic birds from Afghanistan , Turkmenistan , China and Siberia . Some 364 species of birds, including the rare Siberian crane , have been recorded in the park. The name Keoladeo is derived from the name of an ancient Hindu temple devoted to Lord Shiva in the sanctuary's central zone while the Hindi term ghana implies dense, thick areas of forest cover. It is mainly famous for the Siberian crane. It was the only habitat of Siberian crane in the world other than Siberia. Now it no longer comes to the park. The main reasons are the lack of conservation measures in India, diversion of water for farmers instead of saving the wetlands as per then Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's orders, [7] hunting during migration in Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as the war against Taliban in Afghanistan.

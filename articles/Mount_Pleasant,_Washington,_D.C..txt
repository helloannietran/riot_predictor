History [ edit ] 

In 1727, Charles Calvert, 5th Lord Baltimore (then governor of the Maryland Colony ) awarded a land grant for present-day Mount Pleasant to James Holmead. This estate included the territory of present-day Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, and Pleasant Plains neighborhoods. James's son, Anthony, inherited the estate in 1750 and named it Pleasant Plains . After the United States Congress created the District of Columbia in 1791, Pleasant Plains estate became part of Washington County , a section of the District lying between what now is Florida Avenue and the Maryland border. The Holmeads gradually sold off all tracts of the Pleasant Plains estate. In the 21st century, the family name is preserved in Holmead Place, a short street located west of Thirteenth Street between Spring and Park Roads NW, in what now is Columbia Heights. During 1794 and 1796, Robert Peter , Georgetown's pioneer businessman, conducted title descriptions. He created maps for tracts of some of his land in Mount Pleasant for transactions with commissioners of the city. [2] 

During the Civil War , New England native Samuel P. Brown purchased 73 acres (300,000 m 2 ) of land between Fourteenth and Seventeenth Streets, NW. Brown built a house and allowed a wartime hospital to be constructed on his land. After the War, he began selling his land in parcels . He named the area Mount Pleasant Village because it contained the land having the highest elevation of the original Pleasant Plains estate. Brown sold all his land except for the parcel he retained around his house at 3351 Mount Pleasant Street, NW. [3] His house was demolished in the 1890s. 

Most of the original settlers built wooden frame houses and farmed their tracts, growing their own food. Stores and other businesses opened around what today is the intersection of Fourteenth Street and Park Road, NW. Settlers laid out early roads in the area, such as Adams Mill Road, Mount Pleasant Street, Newton Street, and Park Road to follow local custom and to accommodate local needs and land ownership. Although Mount Pleasant was within the District of Columbia, it was separated from the city of Washington by vacant land and was rural by comparison. Because of this separate development, the Mount Pleasant street grid is distinct from Washington's rectilinear grid . Now that the two are part of a single urban fabric, some of its streets appear to have been laid out haphazardly, with several intersecting city streets at odd or severe angles to the greater design. 

In the 1870s, a horse-drawn streetcar began traveling between the Fourteenth and Park intersection to downtown Washington city, making this the first streetcar suburb in the District of Columbia. Mount Pleasant ceased to be an independent and separate place in 1878 after the city's boundaries became coterminous with those of the District. Mount Pleasant developed rapidly as a streetcar suburb after the opening of the mechanized streetcar line around 1900. In 1907, developer Fulton R. Gordon purchased large sections of the neighborhood, marketing lots as "Mount Pleasant Heights" with Robert E. Heater. [4] Many houses and apartment buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1925. In 1925, the District built the Mount Pleasant Library , partially funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , to serve the growing and affluent community.

The streets were lined with tall trees that created a continuous canopy of shade. Gardens of ivy, shrubs, and flowering plants were created in the successive terraces from the streets to the base of the stairs of the typical front porches. Landings in the staircases through the terraces were marked with fountains and sculpture. Houses were built next to each other as row houses. Alleys between all streets provided access for servants and services. Fences separated properties into back yards planted with vegetable gardens and fruit trees, and sites for barns and garages. Many houses were constructed with two levels of cellars below the entry level from the main street, but all having disguised access for landscape equipment through the cellars under the house. Rear sleeping porches extended from the floors with bedrooms. 

Mount Pleasant was marketed to middle- to upper middle-class people. Actress Helen Hayes , Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson , and US Senator Robert LaFollette made their homes in Mount Pleasant. 

The neighborhood entered a period of transition in the 1960s. Mount Pleasant was racially segregated , as were most neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., at the time. This changed after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , although some neighborhoods remained de facto segregated. After an African American Howard University professor moved into a prestigious Park Road home, some white residents began to leave the neighborhood. This form of suburbanization , often referred to as White flight , increased after the 1968 riots , which caused widespread destruction along the commercial U Street NW corridor and other areas of the city. Gradually, as lower-income residents moved in and rented portions of rowhouses divided for multiple occupancy, some properties suffered neglect. Most of the characteristic landscaping was lost, including much of the canopy of shade trees. 

As African Americans began to settle in Mount Pleasant, a new wave of immigrants from Central America came to the capital. Spanish-speaking immigrants began settling in Mount Pleasant in the 1960s, many from El Salvador and the Dominican Republic . Adams Morgan to the west already had a Latino population among its multi-racial residents, and they had developed businesses along Columbia Road and 18th Street that new immigrants found familiar. The new residents also developed businesses catering to Hispanics and Latinos along commercial portions of Mount Pleasant Street. The neighborhood also attracted former Peace Corps workers, who liked the diversity. Commercially developed Columbia Road extended from the Adams Morgan neighborhood to 16th Street. Businesses included grocery store and pharmacy, restaurants, low-priced retail stores and services. 

Affluent professionals began returning to the neighborhood in the early 1980s. According to the Washingtonian magazine, housing prices rose nearly as fast as in any area of metropolitan Washington. The new residents renovated many homes, and some projects were featured in local and national magazines. A $1 million " green " renovation was featured in a National Public Radio story. The neighborhood was majority-minority in 1990, with African Americans making up 36% of the population, Latinos 26%, and whites 35%. More recent Asian immigrants also settled there. The students at the neighborhood public schools were primarily minority children. 

In 1991, a black woman police officer shot a Latino man, leading to a multi-day riot . As a result, the Metropolitan Police Department and city government began an outreach effort to the Latino population. In the next two decades, demographics of the neighborhood changed markedly. As housing prices have gone up, given the strong economy of the District and many educated residents with high-paying jobs, some Latino immigrants and their descendants have moved to more affordable D.C. neighborhoods east of Mount Pleasant, as well as to more distant suburbs. African Americans have also left the neighborhood, to an even greater extent: some have moved to the South, in what the Brookings Institution defines as a New Great Migration , [5] and some have moved to eastern neighborhoods in the District or to suburbs. According to the 2010 census, African Americans compose 19% of the population, the smallest of the three main ethnicities in the neighborhood. Their proportion of the population in the District overall has dropped during these two decades. 

The western four-fifths of the Mount Pleasant area is a largely wooded residential enclave bounded on two sides by Rock Creek Park. Structures in this area are primarily row houses, with some subdivided into one or two apartments. A few of the original 19th-century wood-frame houses remain, mostly north of Park Road. The eastern border of Mount Pleasant, along Sixteenth and Mount Pleasant Streets, is marked by mid-rise apartment buildings. These buildings offer rental apartments, condominiums and cooperatives. A four-block commercial corridor with convenience shopping in the neighborhood extends along Mount Pleasant Street. In 2008, a large retail development was completed in Columbia Heights , the neighborhood just east of Mount Pleasant.

The population of Mount Pleasant, according to the 2010 census, was 10,459, down from 11,794 in 2000. Census data for 1990, 2000, and 2010 show the demographic changes underway in Mount Pleasant: [6] 1990 2000 2010 white non-Hispanic 35% 35% 50% black non-Hispanic 36% 27% 19% Hispanic 26% 31% 25% Asian/Pacific Islander 3.0% 6.3% 5.6%

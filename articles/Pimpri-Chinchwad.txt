The township is situated at a height of 530 m above the sea level. It has pleasant climate all the year round. Three rivers Pavana , Mula and Indrayani flow through this area. Pimpri-Chinchwad sources its water from the Pavana river but release of domestic and industrial effluents, [5] dumping of debris and domestic pollution has severely affected the quality of the Pavana water, though efforts have been taken to improve the quality of water, which have been successful in some places along the riverside. History [ edit ] 

Today's Pimpri-Chinchwad is formed of the formerly independent localities of Chinchwad , Pimpri , Nigdi , Akurdi, Kalewadi, and Bhosari . The name Chinchwad is derived from the trees Chinch (tamarind) and Wad (banyan). Chinchwad is famous for Saint Morya Gosavi ’s Shrine, which is one of the lord Ganesha’s shaktipeeth in Maharashtra state. Due to the flooding of the river Pavana every year, the temple gets submerged in the river water. Local people consider it as bathing of lord Ganesha. Chinchwad is also the birthplace of the Chapekar brothers . Pimpri-Chinchwad is home to the historic town of Bhosari , originally known as Bhojapuri. [6] Two thousand years ago, it was the capital of legendary Hindu king Bhoj. During the period of Mahabharata this town was known as Bhojakata, the capital of the Bhoja-Yadava king Rukmi. It is mentioned in Mahabharata that Bhojakata lay to the west of Kundinapuri, the capital of Vidarbha Kingdom. 

Starting in the mid-1950s the green fields of the villages on the sides of the highway and railways linking Pune to Mumbai became locations of choice for large industrial development. In the 1960s, the newly founded Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) purchased vast tracts of land and built roads and water supply infrastructure. [7] It turned the area into a successful cluster of pharmaceutical, mechanical, automotive, and, more recently, information technology, of national and international importance (see Industries below). Hundreds of thousands of people migrated to the new hub to fill the jobs and benefit from rapid economic development. In 1970, the scattered village jurisdictions merged into one single municipal authority, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Culture [ edit ] 

Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with great rigour and joy, Dasara is also one of the important festival. All industries are closed during that time. Tourism [ edit ] Shree Mahavir Jain Temple Shree Mahavir Jain Temple

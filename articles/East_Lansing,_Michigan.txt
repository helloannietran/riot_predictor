History [ edit ] 

East Lansing was an important junction of two major Native American groups: the Potawatomi and Fox. [6] By 1850, the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company was established to connect a toll road to the Detroit and Howell Plank Road, improving travel between Detroit and Lansing , which cut right through what is now East Lansing. The toll road was finished in 1853, and included seven tollhouses between Lansing and Howell . [7] 

Michigan State University was founded in 1855 and established in what is now East Lansing in 1857. For the first four decades, the students and faculty lived almost entirely on the college campus. A few commuted from Lansing, and that number increased when a streetcar line was built in the 1890s, but there were few places to live in the then-rural area immediately around the campus. 

That started to change in 1887, when professors William J. Beal and Rolla C. Carpenter created Collegeville, along what is now Harrison Road and Center and Beal Streets, north of Michigan Avenue. Few faculty were attracted to the location, and the first residents were "teamsters and laborers". [8] In 1898, the College Delta subdivision (including what is now Delta Street) had the support of the college itself, which provided utilities, and several professors built homes there (one of which survives today at 243 W. Grand River Ave.). [9] Other subdivisions followed. 

At that time, the post office address was "Agricultural College, Michigan." A school district encompassing the nascent community was created in 1900. In 1907, incorporation as a city was proposed under the name "College Park"; the legislature approved the charter but changed the name to "East Lansing." The first seven mayors, starting with Clinton D. Smith in 1907 and Warren Babcock in 1908, were professors or employees of the college. 

The city charter in 1907 prohibited the possession, sale, or consumption of alcoholic beverages, and East Lansing was a "dry" city until voters modified the charter provision in 1968.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 13.67 square miles (35.41 km 2 ), of which 13.59 square miles (35.20 km 2 ) is land and 0.08 square miles (0.21 km 2 ) is water. [1] 

Since 1998, East Lansing has expanded its borders through the use of 425 Agreements . The city is currently in three 425 Agreements with Bath Township , DeWitt Township , and Meridian Township , and has effectively added thousands of acres of land to its border. East Lansing and DeWitt Township entered into two 425s in 1998 and 2001, which involved nearly 1,200 acres (4.9 km 2 ) of land. The agreement stipulates that East Lansing gains full control of the land after 33 years. East Lansing and Bath Township entered into a 425 Agreement in June 2002 involving 1,056 acres (4.27 km 2 ) of land. The agreement stipulates that East Lansing gains full control of the land after 100 years. East Lansing and Meridian Township entered into a 425 in November 2002 involving 101 acres (0.41 km 2 ) of land. The agreement stipulates that the Meridian Township residents get to decide the fate of the land after 100 years. 

The city has also made use of annexation of surrounding township lands in recent years. It annexed the 66.5 acres (269,000 m 2 ) of the Four Winds Golf Course in Meridian Township in 2001, and another 6 acres (24,000 m 2 ) of the township in 2006. The city also annexed from DeWitt Township the land that is currently the East Lansing Soccer Complex. Description [ edit ] 

The city's downtown area is centered around Grand River Avenue , a wide, tree-lined boulevard that evolved out of the 19th-century plank road that connected Lansing to Detroit . Grand River Avenue and Michigan Avenue serves as a dividing line between the Michigan State University campus and the rest of the city. The street is lined with many college-oriented businesses, such as bars , tanning salons, coffee shops , head shops , restaurants (many dine al fresco) and bookstores. Immediately north of downtown are predominantly student neighborhoods . Further north is the residential part of the city. In the northernmost tier of the city are several new housing subdivisions and student-oriented apartment complexes. These new developments are far from the university, but their lower property tax rates allow them to offer students more amenities. Neighborhoods [ edit ] 

East Lansing has more than 25 neighborhoods, many of which have neighborhood associations that sponsor social events, attend to neighborhood issues, and often advocate for neighborhood interests in meetings of the City Council and city commissions. [10] 

A section of the city has been designated a Historic District, and a Historic District Commission has been established by the City Council. [11] In addition, many landmark structures in the older neighborhoods have been identified within a Landmark Structures Historic District of the Historic Preservation Code. [12]

Michigan State University has the reputation of having a very passionate fan base. Spartans followers have attracted notoriety with public celebrations that periodically erupt throughout the year.

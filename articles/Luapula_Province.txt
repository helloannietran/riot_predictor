History [ edit ] Map showing the Congo Pedicle relative to the borders formed by the Luapula River and Congo-Zambezi watershed. 

In the 19th century the valley was dominated by the Lunda kingdom of Mwata Kazembe . [1] The boundaries of the province between Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo were disputed for many years, running from an 1894 treaty into the late 1960s. In the 19th century the valley was dominated by the Lunda kingdom of Mwata Kazembe . [1] The boundaries of the province between Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo were disputed for many years, running from an 1894 treaty into the late 1960s. The province has a long history of opposing colonial rule through militancy. From the 1950s, there were revolutionary groups that support Anti Federationist African National Congress. Post independence, the province was the base for the UNIP militants. Laupula has constant migration of labour from Congo and also from nearby Copperbelt province. During the 1980s, the then President appointed traditional Chiefs of the region as District Governors or members of the powerful UNIP central committee. The practice was seen similar to colonial rule when local leaders were drafted to political domain. Mwata Kazambe was appointed the District Governor for the province by president Kaunda during the 1980s. [2] 

Chiluba, the leader of MMD, who went on to become the President of Zambia in 1991, is considered the son of the soil and the citizens of the province gave him majority mandate during the 1991 elections. The province was the least affected among all areas in the country during the 1991 famine. Agriculture suffered in the region on account of removal of agricultural subsidies and rural credit schemes. [3] 

The province is bordered along the Luapula River , through Lake Mweru and to its north by DR Congo which at times has led to disputes and conflict. The Congo Pedicle comes between the province and the industrial and commercial heartland of the Copperbelt which has caused problems partly resolved by construction of the Luapula Bridge and the Samfya - Serenje road, and being further alleviated by the construction of the Chembe Bridge . The capital of the province is Mansa , which is also the headquarters of Mansa district . [1] Geography [ edit ] 

The province borders along Congo and it extends along the northern and eastern banks of the river from Lake Bangweulu to Lake Mweru , including waters and islands of those lakes. [4] Congo Pedicle , the southeast salient of the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo which sticks into neighbouring Zambia , divides it into two lobes. It is bordered by Northern on the eastern side and Central on the southeastern side. The major towns in the Province include Samfya , Mansa , Nchelege and Mwamsombwe . [5] Around 40% of the Province is covered with water and there are a number of rivers and lakes. It has eight waterfalls, wildlife and cultural heritage. Major mineral deposits found in the province are Manganese , lime , Copper and precious metals.

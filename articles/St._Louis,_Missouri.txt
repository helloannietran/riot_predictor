St. Louis ( / s eɪ n t ˈ l uː ɪ s / ) [10] [11] [12] is an independent city [13] and inland port in the U.S. state of Missouri . The city developed along the western bank of the Mississippi River , which forms Missouri's border with Illinois . In 2010 , St. Louis had a population of 319,294; a 2015 estimate put the population at 315,685, [8] making it the 60th-most populous U.S. city and the second-largest city in Missouri after Kansas City . The St. Louis metropolitan area includes the city as well as nearby areas in Missouri and Illinois; with an estimated population of 2,916,447, it has the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and is the nineteenth largest in the United States . 

St. Louis was founded in 1764 by fur traders Pierre Laclède and Auguste Chouteau , and named after Louis IX of France . Claimed first by the French, who settled mostly east of the Mississippi River, the region in which the city stands was ceded to Spain following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War . Its territory east of the Mississippi was ceded to the Kingdom of Great Britain , the victor. The area of present-day Missouri was part of Spanish Louisiana from 1762 until 1803; the French persuaded King Charles IV of Spain to cede Louisiana back to France in 1800, but the Spanish continued as administrators of the territory until the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. [14] 

After the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase , St. Louis developed as a major port on the Mississippi River. In the late-19th century, St. Louis was ranked as the fourth-largest city in the United States. It separated from St. Louis County in 1877, becoming an independent city and limiting its own political boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and the Summer Olympics . Immigration has increased, and the city is the center of the largest Bosnian population in the world outside their homeland. 

The economy of metro St. Louis relies on service, manufacturing, trade, transportation of goods, and tourism. Its metro area is home to major corporations, including Anheuser-Busch , Express Scripts , Centene , Boeing Air Defense , Emerson , Energizer , Panera , Enterprise , Peabody Energy , Ameren , Ralcorp , Monsanto , Scottrade , Edward Jones , Go Jet , Purina and Sigma-Aldrich . This city has also become known for a growing medical, pharmaceutical and research city. St. Louis has two professional sports teams: the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball and the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League . The city is commonly identified with the 630-foot (192 m) tall Gateway Arch in Downtown St. Louis .

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of St. Louis and Timeline of St. Louis 

The area that would become St. Louis was a center of the Native American Mississippian culture , which built numerous temple and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at Cahokia Mounds , active from 900 AD to 1500 AD. Due to numerous major earthworks within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the "Mound City." These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area included the Siouan -speaking Osage people , whose territory extended west, and the Illiniwek . 

European exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette traveled through the Mississippi River valley. Five years later, La Salle claimed the region for France as part of La Louisiane . 

The earliest European settlements in the area were built in Illinois Country (also known as Upper Louisiana) on the east side of the Mississippi River during the 1690s and early 1700s at Cahokia , Kaskaskia , and Fort de Chartres . Migrants from the French villages on the opposite side of the Mississippi River (e.g. Kaskaskia) founded Ste. Genevieve in the 1730s. 

In 1721 after leaving Quebec, French traveller Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix reached the area, calling it "the finest confluence in the world". [ citation needed ] 

In early 1764, after France lost the Seven Years' War , Pierre Laclède and his stepson Auguste Chouteau founded what was to become the city of St. Louis. [15] (French lands east of the Mississippi had been ceded to Great Britain and the lands west of the Mississippi to Spain; France and Spain were 18th-century allies and both were Catholic nations.) The early French families built the city's economy on the fur trade with the Osage, as well as with more distant tribes along the Missouri River . The Chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from Spain on the fur trade with Santa Fe . French colonists used African slaves as domestic servants and workers in the city. 

From 1762 to 1803 European control of the area west of the Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri River basin, called Louisiana , was assumed by the Spanish as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain . In 1780 during the American Revolutionary War , St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native American allies, in the Battle of St. Louis . [16] Founding and before 19th century [ edit ] 

The founding of St. Louis began in 1763. Pierre Laclede led an expedition to set up a fur-trading post farther up the Mississippi River. Before then, Laclede had been a very successful merchant. For this reason, he and his trading partner Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent were offered monopolies for six years of the fur trading in that area. 

Though they were originally only granted rights to set-up a trading post, Laclede and other members of his expedition quickly set up a settlement. Some historians believe that Laclede's determination to create this settlement was the result of his affair with a married woman Marie-Thérèse Bourgeois Chouteau , and so they wanted to get out of New Orleans. 

Laclede on his initial expedition was accompanied by his young stepson, Auguste Chouteau . Some historians still debate which of the two men was the true founder of St. Louis. The reason for this lingering question is that all the documentation of the founding was loaned, and subsequently destroyed in a fire. 

For the first few years of St. Louis' existence, the city was not recognized by any of the governments. Though originally thought to be under the control of the Spanish government, no one asserted any authority over the settlement, and thus St. Louis had no local government. This led Laclede to assume a position of civil control, and all problems were disposed in public settings, such as conmunal meetings. In addition, Laclede granted new settlers lots in town and the country, to give something to the new settlers to start off with. In hindsight, many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as "the golden age of St. Louis." 

However, by 1765, the city began receiving notifications and visits from representatives and military actives from members of the English, French, and Spanish governments. In addition, the Indians in the local area expressed dissatisfaction to being under the command and control of British forces. One of the great Ottawa chieftain, Pontiac, was angered by the change of power and potential for the British to come into their lands. He desired to fight against them with power and force, but many of the St. Louis inhabitants refused. 

Around this time, a man named St. Ange came and helped make St. Louis more of a successful city, helping deal with all the diplomatic issues from the various nationalities of the British, French, and Spanish governments, along with the local Indians. 19th century [ edit ] 

St. Louis was transferred to the French First Republic in 1800 (although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by Spanish officials), then sold by the French to the U.S. in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase . St. Louis became the capital of, and gateway to, the new territory. Shortly after the official transfer of authority was made, the Lewis and Clark Expedition was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The expedition departed from St. Louis in May 1804 along the Missouri River to explore the vast territory. There were hopes of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, but the party had to go overland in the Upper West. They reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River in summer 1805. They returned, reaching St. Louis on September 23, 1806. Both Lewis and Clark lived in St. Louis after the expedition. Many other explorers, settlers, and trappers (such as Ashley's Hundred ) would later take a similar route to the West. 

The city elected its first municipal legislators (called trustees) in 1808. Steamboats first arrived in St. Louis in 1818, improving connections with New Orleans and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. As the state gained settlers, the first capital of Missouri was St. Louis before eventually moving to the more central location of Jefferson City in 1826. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy port and trade connections. Slaves worked in many jobs on the waterfront as well as on the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the free state of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in freedom suits , and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War. 

Immigrants from Ireland and Germany arrived in St. Louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s, and the population of St. Louis grew from less than 20,000 in 1840, to 77,860 in 1850, to more than 160,000 by 1860. By the mid-1800s, St. Louis had a greater population than New Orleans. An illustrated map by F. Graf entitled Saint Louis in 1896 South Broadway after a May 27, 1896, tornado 

Settled by many Southerners in a slave state , the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the American Civil War . In 1861, 28 civilians were killed in a clash with Union troops . The war hurt St. Louis economically, due to the Union blockade of river traffic to the south on the Mississippi River. The St. Louis Arsenal constructed ironclads for the Union Navy . 

After the war, St. Louis profited via trade with the West, aided by the 1874 completion of the Eads Bridge , named for its architect. Industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge, the first in the mid-west over the Mississippi River. The bridge connects St. Louis, Missouri to East St. Louis, Illinois . The Eads Bridge became an iconic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the Gateway Arch Bridge was constructed. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993. An estimated 8,500 vehicles pass through it daily. 

On August 22, 1876, the city of St. Louis voted to secede from St. Louis County and become an independent city . Industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century. Major corporations such as the Anheuser-Busch brewery and Ralston-Purina company were established. St. Louis also was home to Desloge Consolidated Lead Company and several brass era automobile companies, including the Success Automobile Manufacturing Company ; [17] St. Louis is the site of the Wainwright Building , an early skyscraper built in 1892 by noted architect Louis Sullivan . 20th century [ edit ] 

In 1904, the city hosted the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics , becoming the first non-European city to host the Olympics. [18] Permanent facilities and structures remaining from the fair are Forest Park and associated structures within its boundaries: the St. Louis Art Museum , the St. Louis Zoo and the Missouri History Museum . As well as Tower Grove Park and the Botanical Gardens. 

In the aftermath of emancipation of slaves following the Civil War, social and racial discrimination in housing and employment were common in St. Louis. Starting in the 1910s, many property deeds included racial or religious restrictive covenants against new immigrants and migrants. In the first half of the 20th century, St. Louis was a destination for many African Americans in the Great Migration from the rural South seeking better opportunities. During World War II, the NAACP campaigned to integrate war factories, and restrictive covenants were prohibited in 1948 by the Shelley v. Kraemer U.S. Supreme Court decision, which case originated as a lawsuit in St. Louis. In 1964 civil rights activists protested at the construction of the Gateway Arch to publicize their effort to gain entry for African Americans into the skilled trade unions, where they were underrepresented. The Department of Justice filed the first suit against the unions under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . 

De jure educational segregation continued into the 1950s, and de facto segregation continued into the 1970s, leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement. Students have been bussed mostly from the city to county school districts to have opportunities for integrated classes, although the city has created magnet schools to attract students. [19] 

St. Louis, like many Midwestern cities, expanded in the early 20th century due to industrialization, which provided jobs to new generations of immigrants and migrants from the South. It reached its peak population of 856,796 at the 1950 census. [20] Suburbanization from the 1950s through the 1990s dramatically reduced the city's population, as did restructuring of industry and loss of jobs. The effects of suburbanization were exacerbated by the relatively small geographical size of St. Louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city, and it lost much of its tax base. During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so. 

In the 21st century, the city of St. Louis contains only 11% of its total metropolitan population, while among the top 20 metro areas in the United States, the central cities contain an average of 24% of total metropolitan area population. Although small increases in population have taken place in St. Louis during the early 2000s, overall the city lost population from 2000 to 2010. Immigration has continued, with the city attracting Vietnamese , Latinos from Mexico and Central America, and Bosnians , the latter forming the largest Bosnian community outside of Bosnia . 

Several urban renewal projects were built in the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing. Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems, of which Pruitt-Igoe became a symbol of failure. It was torn down. 

Since the 1980s, several revitalization efforts have focused on downtown St. Louis . 21st century [ edit ] 

Urban revitalization continued in the new century. Gentrification has taken place in the Washington Avenue Historic District . [21] In 2006, St. Louis received the World Leadership Award for urban renewal. [22] In 2013 the US Census Bureau estimate that St. Louis had a population of 318,416. [7] 

In 2014, St. Louis celebrated its 250th birthday with events throughout the year. These were coordinated by the Missouri History Museum through its nonprofit entity, stl250, with help from the Saint Louis Ambassadors volunteer organization and its U.S. Small Business Institute. Commemorations of the Arch's 50th birthday took place in 2015. Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of St. Louis Topography [ edit ] Rivers in the St. Louis area. 

According to the United States Census Bureau , St. Louis has a total area of 66 square miles (170 km 2 ), of which 62 square miles (160 km 2 ) is land and 4.1 square miles (11 km 2 ) (6.2%) is water. [23] (Not shown on simple maps of the city, the land at its airport is owned by the city, served by its fire department and others, and is an exclave of St. Louis.) The city is built primarily on bluffs and terraces that rise 100–200 feet above the western banks of the Mississippi River, in the Midwestern United States just south of the Missouri -Mississippi confluence . Much of the area is a fertile and gently rolling prairie that features low hills and broad, shallow valleys. Both the Mississippi River and the Missouri River have cut large valleys with wide flood plains. 

Limestone and dolomite of the Mississippian epoch underlie the area, and parts of the city are karst in nature. This is particularly true of the area south of downtown, which has numerous sinkholes and caves. Most of the caves in the city have been sealed, but many springs are visible along the riverfront. Coal, brick clay , and millerite ore were once mined in the city. The predominant surface rock, known as St. Louis limestone , is used as dimension stone and rubble for construction. 

Near the southern boundary of the city of St. Louis (separating it from St. Louis County ) is the River des Peres , practically the only river or stream within the city limits that is not entirely underground. [24] Most of River des Peres was confined to a channel or put underground in the 1920s and early 1930s. The lower section of the river was the site of some of the worst flooding of the Great Flood of 1993 . 

The city's eastern boundary is the Mississippi River, which separates Missouri from Illinois. The Missouri River forms the northern line of St. Louis County, except for a few areas where the river has changed its course. The Meramec River forms most of its southern line. Cityscape [ edit ] Westward view of St. Louis skyline, September 2008. Neighborhoods [ edit ] Further information: Neighborhoods of St. Louis 

The city is divided into 79 government-designated neighborhoods. [25] The neighborhood divisions have no legal standing, although some neighborhood associations administer grants or hold veto power over historic-district development.

St. Louis lies in the transitional zone between the humid continental climate type and the humid subtropical climate type ( Köppen Dfa and Cfa , respectively), with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. The city experiences hot, humid summers and cold winters. It is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico . The average annual temperature recorded at nearby Lambert–St. Louis International Airport , is 57.1 °F (13.9 °C). Both 100 and 0 °F (38 and −18 °C) temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. [26] Average annual precipitation is about 41.0 inches (1,040 mm), [26] but annual precipitation has ranged from 20.59 in (523 mm) in 1953 to 61.24 in (1,555 mm) in 2015. [27] The city has four distinct seasons: Spring (March through May) is typically the wettest season, with 11.7 in (297 mm) of precipitation, although dry spells lasting one to two weeks are possible during the growing seasons. Spring produces severe weather ranging from tornadoes to winter storms . St. Louis has thunderstorms 48 days a year on average. [28] Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes. Lying near the hotbed of the Tornado Alley , St. Louis is one of the metropolitan areas with most frequent tornadoes. The area has an extensive history of damaging tornadoes but they seldom touch down in the city. The average date of the last freeze is April 3. [27] Summers (June through mid September) are hot and humid; temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher occur 43 days a year. [29] The daily average temperature in July is 80.0 °F (26.7 °C). The record high temperature is 115 °F (46 °C) on July 14, 1954. [30] July 2012 was the hottest month in the 138-year recorded weather temperatures in St. Louis history starting in 1874, with an average daily temperature of 88.1 °F (31.2 °C). [30] The 25th of that month also tied the all-time record warm daily minimum of 86 °F (30 °C), first set July 24, 1901. [27] Fall (Mid September through November) is mild and sunny, with lower humidity. There can be periods of heavy rainfall, with the first measurable snow usually falling around December 4. [26] Peak fall foliage occurs in mid-to-late October, [31] with the average date of the first freeze falling on November 1. [27] Some late autumns feature a period of warm weather known as Indian summer ; in some years roses still bloom as late as early December. Winter (December through February) can range from chilly to cold, and can be highly variable. High temperatures below freezing occur 25 days per year, on average. However, it is not uncommon to have 50+ degree days. Each winter usually has at least one major snowstorm accumulating 4 inches or more, though snow on the ground rarely lasts for more than a few days at a time. The season can also bring comparable amounts of rain; nonetheless, it is typically the driest season. Winter storm systems, such as Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks , can yield heavy freezing rain, ice pellets, and snowfall, typically followed by a few days of clear but very cold weather. The daily average temperature in January is 31.8 °F (−0.1 °C). The official record low is −22 °F (−30 °C) on January 5, 1884, although there were unofficial readings of −23 °F (−31 °C) on January 29, 1873; [30] the record cold daily maximum is −5 °F (−21 °C) on Christmas Eve 1983. [27] The average amount of winter precipitation is 7.5 in (191 mm). The average seasonal snowfall is 17.7 inches (45 cm), historically ranging from 1.5 in (3.8 cm) in 1953−54 to 67.6 in (172 cm) in 1911−12.

Before the founding of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly oak , maple , and hickory , similar to the forests of the nearby Ozarks ; common understory trees include eastern redbud , serviceberry , and flowering dogwood . Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore . 

Most of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees. The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is Japanese honeysuckle , which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks. 

Large mammals found in the city include urbanized coyotes and white-tailed deer . Eastern gray squirrel , cottontail rabbit , and other rodents are abundant, as well as the nocturnal Virginia opossum . Large bird species are abundant in parks and include Canada goose , mallard duck , as well as shorebirds , including the great egret and great blue heron . Gulls are common along the Mississippi River; these species typically follow barge traffic. 

Winter populations of bald eagles are found along the Mississippi River around the Chain of Rocks Bridge . The city is on the Mississippi Flyway , used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern US. The Eurasian tree sparrow , an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including Tower Grove Park . 

Frogs are commonly found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the American toad and species of chorus frogs commonly called spring peepers , which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs . Mosquitos, no-see-ums , and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are nearly universally fitted with screens. Invasive populations of honeybees have sharply declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and armadillos have been regularly seen throughout the St. Louis area, especially since 2005.

St. Louis grew slowly until the American Civil War, when industrialization and immigration sparked a boom. Mid-19th century immigrants included many Irish and Germans; later there were immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. In the early 20th century, African American and white migrants came from the South; the former as part of the Great Migration out of rural areas of the Deep South. Many came from Mississippi and Arkansas. 

After years of immigration, migration, and expansion, the city reached its peak population in 1950. That year, the Census Bureau reported St. Louis' population as 82% White and 17.9% African American . [44] After World War II, St. Louis began losing population to the suburbs, first because of increased demand for new housing, unhappiness with city services, ease of commuting by subsidized highways, and later, white flight . [47] St. Louis' population decline has resulted in a significant increase of abandoned residential housing units and vacant lots throughout the city proper; this blight has attracted much wildlife (such as deer and coyotes) to the many abandoned overgrown lots. 

St. Louis has lost 62.7% of its population since the 1950 United States Census , the highest percent of any city that had a population of 100,000 or more at the time of the 1950 Census . Detroit , Michigan and Youngstown, Ohio are the only other cities that have had population declines of at least 60% in the same time frame. The population of the city of St. Louis has been in decline since the 1960 census; during this period the population of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which includes more than one county, has grown every year and continues to do so. A big factor in the decline has been the rapid increase in suburbanization. 

According to the 2010 United States Census , St. Louis had 319,294 people living in 142,057 households, of which 67,488 households were families. The population density was 5,158.2 people per square mile (1,990.6/km²). About 24% of the population was 19 or younger, 9% were 20 to 24, 31% were 25 to 44, 25% were 45 to 64, and 11% were 65 or older. The median age was about 34 years. Saint Louis Demographic, African American by Census Tract. 

The population was about 49.2% African American, 43.9% White (42.2% Non-Hispanic White) , 2.9% Asian, 0.3% Native American/Alaska Native, and 2.4% reporting two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.5% of the population. [48] 

The African-American population is concentrated in the north side of the city (the area north of Delmar Boulevard is 94.0% black, compared with 35.0% in the central corridor and 26.0% in the south side of St. Louis [49] ). Among the Asian-American population in the city, the largest ethnic group is Vietnamese (0.9%), followed by Chinese (0.6%) and Asian Indians (0.5%). The Vietnamese community has concentrated in the Dutchtown neighborhood of south St. Louis; Chinese are concentrated in the Central West End . [50] [ not in citation given ] People of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group, and make up 2.2% of St. Louis' population. They have the highest concentration in the Dutchtown, Benton Park West (Cherokee Street), and Gravois Park neighborhoods. [48] 

In 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $29,156, and the median income for a family was $32,585. Males had a median income of $31,106; females, $26,987. Per capita income was $18,108. 

Some 19% of the city's housing units were vacant, and slightly less than half of these were vacant structures not for sale or rent. 

In 2010, St. Louis' per-capita rates of online charitable donations and volunteerism were among the highest among major U.S. cities. [51] 

As of 2010, 91.05% (270,934) of St. Louis city residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language , while 2.86% (8,516) spoke Spanish, 0.91% (2,713) Bosnian, 0.74% (2,200) Vietnamese, 0.50% (1,495) African languages, 0.50% (1,481) Chinese, and French was spoken as a main language by 0.45% (1,341) of the population over the age of five. In total, 8.95% (26,628) of St. Louis' population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English. [52] Bosnian population [ edit ] See also: History of the Bosnians in St. Louis 

About 15 families from Bosnia settled in St. Louis in 1960 and 1970. After the Bosnian War started in 1992, more Bosnian refugees began arriving and by 2000, tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees settled in St. Louis with the help of Catholic aid societies. Many of them were professionals and skilled workers who had to take any job opportunity to be able to support their families. Most Bosnians refugees are Muslim, ethnically Bosniaks (87%); they have settled primarily in south St. Louis and South County. Bosnian-Americans are well integrated into the city, developing many businesses and ethnic/cultural organizations. [53] 

An estimated 70,000 Bosnians live in the metro area, the largest population of Bosnians in the United States and the largest Bosnian population outside their homeland. The highest concentration of Bosnians is in the neighborhood of Bevo Mill and in Affton , Mehlville , and Oakville of south St. Louis County .

Main article: Culture of St. Louis See also: St. Louis cuisine 

With its French past and waves of Catholic immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Ireland, Germany and Italy, St. Louis is a major center of Roman Catholicism in the United States . St. Louis also boasts the largest Ethical Culture Society in the United States, and consistently ranks as one of the most generous cities in the United States, ranking ninth in 2013. [75] Several places of worship in the city are noteworthy, such as the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , home of the world's largest mosaic installation. [76] 

Other locally notable churches include the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France , the oldest Roman Catholic cathedral west of the Mississippi River and the oldest church in St. Louis; the St. Louis Abbey , whose distinctive architectural style garnered multiple awards at the time of its completion in 1962; and St. Francis de Sales Oratory , a neo-Gothic church completed in 1908 in South St. Louis and the second-largest church in the city. 

The city is defined by music and the performing arts, especially its association with blues , jazz , and ragtime . St. Louis is home to the St. Louis Symphony , the second-oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, which has toured nationally and internationally to strong reviews. Until 2010, it was also home to KFUO-FM , one of the oldest classical music FM radio stations west of the Mississippi River. [77] 

The Gateway Arch marks downtown St. Louis and a historic center that includes the Federal courthouse where the Dred Scott case was first argued, a newly renovated and expanded public library, major churches and businesses, and retail. An increasing downtown residential population has taken to adapted office buildings and other historic structures. In nearby University City is the Delmar Loop , ranked by the American Planning Association as a "great American street" for its variety of shops and restaurants, and the Tivoli Theater, all within walking distance. Ted Drewes Frozen Custard in Saint Louis, Missouri, Route 66 location 

Unique city and regional cuisine reflecting various immigrant groups include toasted ravioli , gooey butter cake , provel cheese , the slinger , the Gerber sandwich , the St. Paul sandwich , and St. Louis-style pizza , featuring thin crust and provel cheese. Some St. Louis chefs have begun emphasizing use of local produce, meats and fish, and neighborhood farmers' markets have become increasingly popular, as well as one downtown. Artisan bakeries, salumeria, and chocolatiers also operate in the city. 

Also unique to St. Louis is the Ted Drewes "Concrete", which is frozen custard blended with any combination of dozens of ingredients, served in a large yellow cup with a spoon and straw. The mixture is so thick that a spoon inserted into the custard does not fall if the cup is inverted. [78] Ted Drewes owns and operates a pair of frozen custard shops in St. Louis, which have been highlighted in the national media on several occasions. In 2006, the Route 66 (Chippewa) location was featured on the Food Network show Feasting on Asphalt , hosted by Alton Brown . In 2010, it was recommended by Bobby Flay on the "Sweet Tooth" episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate . In 2011, it was featured in a special " Route 66 " episode of Man v. Food Nation , hosted by Adam Richman . Architecture [ edit ] Further information: Architecture of St. Louis , List of tallest buildings in St. Louis , and Landmarks of St. Louis 

The architecture of St. Louis exhibits a variety of commercial, residential, and monumental architecture . St. Louis is known for the Gateway Arch , the tallest monument constructed in the United States at 630 feet (190 m). [79] The Arch pays homage to Thomas Jefferson and St. Louis' position as the gateway to the West. Architectural influences reflected in the area include French Colonial , German , early American , and modern architectural styles. Skyscrapers [ edit ] Further information: List of tallest buildings in St. Louis A cluster of skyscrapers is located just west of the Gateway Arch and the Mississippi River. 

Some notable post-modern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the One US Bank Plaza (1976), the AT T Center (1986), and One Metropolitan Square (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis. One US Bank Plaza, the local headquarters for US Bancorp , was constructed for the Mercantile Bancorporation in the Structural expressionist style, emphasizing the steel structure of the building. 

During the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse (completed in 2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit . The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: the Park East Tower in the Central West End and the Roberts Tower located in downtown. Landmarks and monuments [ edit ] Further information: Landmarks of St. Louis, Missouri St. Louis Union Station . 

Several examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France (locally referred to as the Old Cathedral ). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and Christ Church Cathedral (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style. 

Only a few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The Old St. Louis County Courthouse (locally known as the Old Courthouse ) was completed in 1864 and was notable for having an early cast iron dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the U.S. Customhouse and Post Office . 

Because much of the city's early commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called Laclede's Landing . Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery , which date to the early 1860s. St. Louis City Hall, built in 1904 

St. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis , designed by Thomas P. Barnett and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the Neo-Byzantine style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the St. Stanislaus Kostka , which is an example of the Polish Cathedral style . Among the other major designs of the period were St. Alphonsus Liguori (locally known as The Rock Church ) (1867) in the Gothic Revival and Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis (1900) in Richardsonian Romanesque . The central branch of the St. Louis Public Library, designed by Cass Gilbert (1912) 

Early in the 20th century (and during the years before and after the 1904 World's Fair), several churches moved to the Central West End neighborhood, near Forest Park and the fairgrounds. The neighborhood features the Holy Corners Historic District , which is a concentration of several historic religious structures, such as the First Church of Christ, Scientist (1904). 

By the 1900 census , St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a world's fair at Forest Park called the Louisiana Purchase Exposition . Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the Saint Louis Art Museum designed by Cass Gilbert , part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the St. Louis Zoo . The Missouri History Museum was built afterward, with the profit from the fair. But 1904 left other assets to the city, like Theodore Link 's 1894 St. Louis Union Station , and an improved Forest Park. 

Louis Sullivan designed Charlotte Dickson Wainwright's tomb on the north side of Bellefontaine Cemetery , surrounded by a collection of similar tombs for the great old St. Louis families, interesting for their late- Gilded Age artwork. 

Shortly after the Civil War, St. Louis rapidly increased its school system and hospital system. One of the earliest structures and the oldest extant hospital building in St. Louis is the St. Louis Insane Asylum (now the Metropolitan St. Louis Psychiatric Center). The asylum is built of brick in the Italianate style, complete with cast iron dome and cupola reminiscent of the Old Courthouse. 

As St. Louis expanded, the city hall was moved further west of downtown to its present location in 1904 (construction began in 1892). St. Louis City Hall, still in use, was designed by Harvey Ellis in the Renaissance Revival style , reminiscent of the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) in Paris, France. 

Other significant civic buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century include the U.S. Customhouse and Post Office by Alfred B. Mullett (1873) and the stately St. Louis Public Library by Cass Gilbert (1912). While the Old Post Office has been renovated, the St. Louis Public Library is slated for renovation as of 2010. In 1923 the city passed a $87 million bond issue for re-development of the Civic Plaza along the lines of the City Beautiful movement. This development resulted in some of St. Louis's major civic architecture: the Soldiers' Memorial , the Civil Courts Building , and Kiel Auditorium . 

Then into the 1940s and 1950s a certain subgenre of St. Louis modernism emerged, with the locally important architect Harris Armstrong , and a series of daring modern civic landmarks like Gyo Obata 's Planetarium , the geodesic-dome Climatron , and the main terminal building at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport . The Poplar Street Bridge , a 647-foot (197 m) long (197m) deck girder bridge , was built in 1967 and continues to carry two Interstates (Interstates 55 and 64) and one U.S. route (U.S. 40) across the Mississippi River (until February 2014 it carried a third Interstate, I-70). St. Louis also was the headquarters for postwar modernist bank designer Wenceslaus Sarmiento , whose major work in St. Louis is the Chancery Building (1965) on the grounds of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. The culmination of St. Louis modern architecture is Eero Saarinen 's magnificent stainless-steel gesture, the Gateway Arch, centerpiece of the 91-acre (370,000 m 2 ) riverside Jefferson National Expansion Memorial . A panoramic view of the St. Louis skyline, dominated by the 630-foot (190 m) Gateway Arch .

Johannesburg ( / dʒ oʊ ˈ h æ n ᵻ s b ɜːr ɡ / ; Afrikaans: [joˈɦɐnəsbœrχ] ; also known as Jozi , Joburg , eGoli , and abbreviated as JHB ) is the largest city in South Africa and is one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world . [7] It is the provincial capital of Gauteng , which is the wealthiest province in South Africa. [8] While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities , it is the seat of the Constitutional Court . The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills and is the center of large-scale gold and diamond trade. [ citation needed ] 

In 2011, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 4,434,827, making it the largest city in South Africa. [9] In the same year, the population of Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area was 7,860,781. [10] Some view the area surrounding the city of Johannesburg yet more broadly than the metropolitan area, adding Ekurhuleni , West Rand and Lenasia ; that larger area had a population of 10,267,700 in 2007. [11] The land area of the municipal city 1,645 km 2 (635 sq mi) is large in comparison with those of other major cities, resulting in a moderate population density of 2,364/km 2 (6,120/sq mi). 

The city was named and established in 1886 following the discovery of gold on what had been a farm. The city is commonly interpreted as the modern day El Dorado [ by whom? ] due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the Witwatersrand . The name is attributed to one or all of three men involved in the establishment of the city. In ten years, the population was 100,000 inhabitants. 

A separate city from the late 1970s until the 1990s, Soweto is now part of Johannesburg. Originally an acronym for " So uth- We stern To wnships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been separated as a residential area for blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of Indian descent.

Etymology [ edit ] 

Controversy surrounds the origin of the name, as there were any number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them are the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general, Johannes Rissik, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, member of the Volksraad and the Republic's chief of mining, and Stephanus Johannes Paulus "Paul" Kruger , president of the South African Republic (ZAR) 1883-1900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost. [12] Rissik and Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to attain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik Street is today a main street where the historically important and dilapidated [13] Post Office, since burnt out, [14] and the City Hall are located. History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Johannesburg and Timeline of Johannesburg The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886 

The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by San people . By the 13th century, groups of Bantu -speaking people started moving southwards from central Africa and encroached on the indigenous San population. By the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various Sotho–Tswana communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now Botswana in the west, to present day Lesotho in the south, to the present day Pedi areas of the northern Transvaal. [ citation needed ] 

More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated. The Sotho–Tswana practised farming, raised cattle, sheep and goats, and extensively mined and smelted copper, iron and tin. Moreover, from the early 1960s until his retirement, Professor Revil Mason, of the University of the Witwatersrand , explored and documented many Late Iron Age archaeological sites throughout the Johannesburg area, dating from between the 12th century and 18th century, and many of these sites contained the ruins of Sotho–Tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold. The most prominent site within Johannesburg is Melville Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace. [15] 

Many Sotho–Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from Zululand during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the mfecane or difaqane wars) [ citation needed ] , and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the Ndebele (often referred to by the name the local Sotho–Tswana gave them, the Matebele), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern day Rustenburg. Gold rush and naming of the city [ edit ] Main article: Witwatersrand Gold Rush 

The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by Jan Gerritse Bantjes that triggered the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the start of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organization for the area. Johann and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost. [12] Within ten years, the city of Johannesburg included 100,000 people. [16] 

In September 1884 the Struben brothers discovered the Confidence Reef on the farm Wilgespruit near present-day Roodepoort, which further boosted excitement over gold prospects. [ citation needed ] The first gold to be crushed on the Witwatersrand was the gold-bearing rock from the Bantjes mine crushed using the Struben brothers stamp machine. Also, news of the discovery soon reached Kimberley and directors Cecil Rhodes with Sir Joseph Robinson rode up to investigate rumors for themselves. They were guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights. [ citation needed ] 

In 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for £3000. Incidentally, Bantjes had since 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discovery - the early ancestors of all mankind. [ citation needed ] Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886. He did not stay in the area. [17] 

Gold was earlier discovered some 400 kilometres (249 miles) to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in Barberton . Gold prospectors soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the Witwatersrand offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col Ignatius Ferreira , was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following upon the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of Ferreirasdorp . The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887. [16] The government took over the Ferreira's camp, surveyed it and named it as Ferreira's Township. [18] By 1896 Johannesburg was established as a city of over 100,000 inhabitants, one of the fastest growth cities ever. [16] Rapid growth, Jameson Raid and the Second Boer War [ edit ] 

Like many late 19th century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers who cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and Zulu "AmaWasha", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work. [19] As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the Boer government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the Jameson Raid that ended in fiasco at Doornkop in January 1896 and the Second Boer War (1899–1902) that saw British forces under Lord William occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south of its then-limits. [ citation needed ] 

Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust – today's Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturena – the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May. [20] [21] 

During the war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as "Asian", but as "Coloured". The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were Whites . [22] Post-Union history [ edit ] Pritchard Street c. 1940 

Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard. [ citation needed ] In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hillbrow went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as Soweto . New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city. [ citation needed ] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the Carlton Centre and the Southern Life Centre ) filled the skyline of the central business district. Street scene in Johannesburg in 1970 

The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres. Sandton City was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and Eastgate in 1979. [23] 

On 12 May 2008, a series of riots started in the township of Alexandra , in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from Mozambique , Malawi and Zimbabwe , killing two people and injuring 40 others. These riots sparked the xenophobic attacks of 2008. [24]

Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the Highveld , at an elevation of 1,753 metres (5,751 ft). The former Central Business District is located on the south side of the prominent ridge called the Witwatersrand ( Afrikaans : White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the Jukskei River while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the Klip River . The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter. 

Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers – the Limpopo and the Orange. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with "fontein", meaning "spring" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams – giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, "the ridge of white waters". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain. [25] Climate [ edit ] An aerial photograph of summer rain clouds over Johannesburg. The city's climate is experiences regular daily thunderstorms from November to March in the afternoons. 

Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a subtropical highland climate ( Köppen Cwb ). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights. [26] Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F), dropping to an average maximum of around 16 °C (61 °F) in June. The UV index for Johannesburg in summers is extreme, often reaching 14-16 due to the high elevation and proximity to the equator. [27] 

Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to 4.1 °C (39.4 °F) in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost . Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the 21st century, there has been light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to 10 centimetres (4 in) in the southern suburbs) [28] and 7 August 2012. [29] 

Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is 713 millimetres (28.1 in), which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. The lowest nighttime minimum temperature ever recorded in Johannesburg is −8.2 °C (17.2 °F), on 13 June 1979. The lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded is 1.5 °C (34.7 °F), on 19 June 1964.

The city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city. [34] Johannesburg like many metropolises has more than one CBD, Johannesburg has many including but not limited to Sandton CBD, Rosebank CBD, Roodepoort CBD and some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as another. 

Due to its many different central districts Johannesburg would fall under the multiple nuclei model in human geography terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. Randburg and Sandton form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of 6 square kilometres (2 sq mi). It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the Carlton Centre , Marble Towers , Trust Bank Building , Ponte City Apartments , Southern Life Centre and 11 Diagonal Street .

The Southern Life Centre Architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of Johannesburg 

Johannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the Sentech Tower , Hillbrow Tower , the Carlton Centre and Ponte City Apartments . The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as IBM , Absa , BHP Billiton , Willis Group , First National Bank , Nedbank and Standard Bank . Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is Hillbrow , the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is Braamfontein , a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being Victorian Colonial , Edwardian Baroque , Art Deco and Modernism . Parks and gardens [ edit ] Main article: Johannesburg City Parks 

Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo . [35] City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city with the number growing every year – 1.2 million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8 million in private gardens. [36] City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg's urban planning. 

Johannesburg Botanical Garden , located in the suburb of Emmarentia , is a popular recreational park. Public art [ edit ] 

The city is home to an extensive portfolio of public art. Johannesburg has an active art scene and a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally renowned artists including William Kentridge and Gerhard Marx ’s Fire Walker . Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture in Hillbrow and the City Centre. 

As part of the Johannesburg Development Agency’s (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city and support South African. A percentage of every JDA project is allocated to a public art installation.

In 2015, Johannesburg-East Rand was ranked 42nd by population among 992 urban areas of the world. [43] It is 28th in land area, among 1,008 urban areas. [44] As to population density, Johannesburg-East Rand ranks 807th among more than 1,000 urban areas (many ties in this list). An interesting contrast is that Johannesburg-East Rand ranks higher in density than the New York, NY-NJ-CT urban area, which ranks 914 on the same list.

After apartheid era, the present day City of Johannesburg was created from eleven existing local authorities, seven of which were white and four black or coloured . The white authorities were 90% self-sufficient from property tax and other local taxes, and produced and spent R 600 (US$93) per person in municipal services, while the black authorities were only 10% self-sufficient, spending R 100 (US$15) per person in municipal services. [46] Although Johannesburg was divided into eleven administrative regions, these new divisions did not correspond to the areas governed by the former local authorities. [47] Later, in 2006, the number of administrative regions was consolidated, from eleven to seven. The reason given was to separate powers between the legislative and executive bodies of the City. [48] 

The first post-apartheid City Council was created in 1995. [47] The council adopted the slogan " One City, One Taxpayer " to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution. [ citation needed ] To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a substantially autonomous local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like Sandton and Randburg , poorer neighbouring townships such as Soweto and Alexandra , and informal settlements like Orange Farm . [47] 

However, the new post-apartheid City Council ran into problems in part due to inexperienced management and political pressure, which contributed to over-ambitious revenue projections, over-spending, wasted expenditures and out-right fraud. [49] In the newly combined metropole services were unnecessarily duplicated. But, by far, the biggest financial drain was the failure to collect revenues for services, which ranged from rent (rates) to utilities. Part of this failure was a result of the anti-apartheid boycott of paying the government. [46] [47] 

In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager to reshape the city's ailing financial situation. [46] [50] The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called "iGoli 2002". This was a restructuring plan to be completed in 2002, that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. While strongly opposed by unions who feared a loss of jobs, the plan went into effect and returned some sectors into "cash cows" that helped support the city in general. [51] Although some jobs were lost, there were no mass firings, as agencies used attrition to remove excess staff. [52] The plan took the city from near insolvency [50] to an operating surplus of R 153 million (US$23.6 million). [46] Urban sustainability analysis of the greater urban area of the city using the 'Circles of Sustainability' method of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme 

Following the relative success of iGoli 2002, the city undertook a number of initiatives both to help equalise municipal services benefits, such as the water utility's Free Basic Water policy, and to curb fraud and increase payment percentages, such as the water utility's Operation Gcin'amanzi to repipe areas to eliminate siphonage and to install water meters for excess use. [53] Nonetheless, according to the opposition party, fraud, theft and non-payment still remained problems as of 2013 [update] . [54] In fiscal year 2011, the city's audit had R 45,796 million chalked up to fraudulent activities. [55] In 2013, the city admitted that it would be unable to collect two-thirds of the R 18 billion in outstanding billings. [56] 

As of August 2013, the ruling political party, African National Congress, had an overwhelming majority and administered the City of Johannesburg. Although other political parties have seats in the Johannesburg municipality, they have very little influence. The Democratic Alliance is the official opposition in the Johannesburg municipality and has won many Wards in the city. One would find DA wards more in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, but surprisingly the DA won a ward in Soweto. Which showed that people were not too happy with service delivery as provided by the ANC. 

In the 2016 municipal elections, the ruling party, the ANC, lost their majority in Johannesburg for the first time since taking power in 1994, claiming only 44.12% of the vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance both agreed to vote for the DA mayoral candidate, Herman Mashaba , who was sworn into power as the first Democratic Alliance mayor of Johannesburg on 22 August 2016. [57] Coats of arms [ edit ] Municipal (1) [ edit ] 

The Johannesburg municipal council assumed a coat of arms in 1907, and had it granted by the College of Arms on 20 August 1907. The design, by W. Sandford Cotterill, consisted only of a shield : Vert, a fess between three battery stamps Or (i.e. a green shield displaying a golden horizontal stripe between three battery stamps). The motto was Fortiter et recte . [58] 

In May 1939, the College of Arms granted a crest (a gold lion resting a paw on a battery stamp) and supporters (two sable antelope, each with a gold mural crown around its neck and a gold star on its shoulder). 

The full achievement of arms was registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in November 1951 [59] and at the Bureau of Heraldry in November 1966. [60] Municipal (2) [ edit ] Johannesburg civic coat of arms (1997) 

The Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council assumed a new coat of arms in 1997, and registered it at the Bureau of Heraldry in November 1997. [60] 

The arms are : Vert, a fret couped Or, the mascle voided Gules, between in chief and in base respectively four shield thongs Argent; behind the shield a spine erect Or, plumed Sable . 

The supporters are two young golden lions, each wearing a red and blue beaded collar; the motto is Unity in development . Crime [ edit ] 

After the Group Areas Act was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by urban blight . Thousands of poor, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like Soweto and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by landlords , especially in high-density areas, such as Hillbrow . Many corporations and institutions, including the stock exchange , moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like Sandton . [61] 

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include closed-circuit television on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech CCTV surveillance. [62] The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the Central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds. [62] 

Urban renewal has taken place in once no go zones such as Braamfontein, Newtown, and the CBD. An example is the once gangster paradise Braamfontein now hosting the best rated coffeehouse in the world and Newtown hosting an interactive science museum. [ citation needed ] 

Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow. [63] Between 2001 and 2006, R9-billion (US$1.2 billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-billion (US$1.5 billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. [64] In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , local government enlisted the help of Rudy Giuliani , former Mayor of New York City , to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament were played in the city. [65] 

Murders in the Johannesburg municipality amounted to 1,697 in 2007 according to the South African Medical Research Council, a rate of 1 per 2326 inhabitants. [66] Economy [ edit ] The JSE 

Johannesburg is one of the world's leading financial centres [67] and it is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity. [ citation needed ] In a 2008 survey conducted by MasterCard , Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa). [68] 

Mining was the foundation of the Witwatersrand 's economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the city limits , most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. [ citation needed ] Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the JSE although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions. 

The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of Lesotho , the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project , but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century. 

The container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest "dry port" in the world [ citation needed ] , with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of Durban and Cape Town arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government. [ citation needed ] Retail [ edit ]

Melrose Arch is one of its most prestigious. [ citation needed ] Other centres include Hyde Park Corner (shopping centre) , Rosebank , Southgate , The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in Midrand , but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of Mall of Africa. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in Zulu language , indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened. [69] Communications and media [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

The city is home to several media groups which own a number of newspaper and magazine titles. The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The country's electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region. Beeld is a leading Afrikaans newspaper for the city and the country [ citation needed ] , while the City Press is a Sunday newspaper that is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa [ citation needed ] . 

The Sowetan is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived tabloids. The Mail Guardian is an investigative liberal newspaper while The Citizen is a tabloid -style paper, and The Star is a local newspaper that mostly covers Gauteng -related issues. The Sunday Times is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper [ citation needed ] . True Love is the most widely read women's magazine [ citation needed ] , catering primarily to the up-and-coming middle class black female market, published by Media 24. The Times is a national newspaper that covers current issues. [ citation needed ] 

Media ownership is relatively complicated with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism. [ citation needed ] Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as YFM , Metro FM, Phalaphala FM , Talk Radio 702, Highveld Stereo now known as 947, 5FM , UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government sold off frequencies to private companies. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster South African Broadcasting Corporation and pay-broadcast network Multichoice which distributes M-Net and DStv a digital satellite service, while eTV also has a presence in the city. The city has two television towers, the Hillbrow Tower and the Sentech Tower . [ citation needed ] 

Johannesburg has 4 major cellular telecommunications operators: Vodacom , MTN , Cell C , and Telkom Mobile . Vodacom's global headquarters is located in Midrand .

Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. While the Central Business District and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas, the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds. The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include Yeoville , a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some townships . 

The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the local African middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city with the city starting to sprawl northwards and multiple secondary CBDs forming in the north towards Pretoria, an interesting fact is that the area/suburb of Centurion is much closer to the CBD of Pretoria and yet it was recently demarcated as part of the City Of Johannsesburg municipality. 

Traditionally the northern and north-western suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as Hyde Park , Sandhurst , Northcliff , Hurlingham , Bryanston and Houghton , where Nelson Mandela made his home. The north-western area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of Sophiatown once centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured Melville featuring restaurants and nightlife. Auckland Park is home to the headquarters of the South African Broadcasting Corporation , AFDA (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the University of Johannesburg . 

To the southwest of the city centre is Soweto , a township constructed during apartheid for housing displaced black South Africans then living in areas designated for white settlement. To the south of Johannesburg is Lenasia , a predominantly Asian neighbourhood which was constructed during apartheid specifically to house Asians.

Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to Cape Town , Durban , and the Kruger National Park . Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of several attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred on history museums, such as the Apartheid Museum (with related visits to Constitution Hill ) and the Hector Pieterson Museum . There is also a large industry around visiting former townships , such as Soweto and Alexandra . Most visitors to Soweto see the Mandela Museum , which is located in the former home of Nelson Mandela . 

Visitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the Carlton Centre , in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At 223 metres (731 ft), it is the highest office building in Africa and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The nearby Museum Africa covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of rock art . Also a large draw for tourists is Gold Reef City , a theme park which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an underground mine tour; other attractions include a large amusement park and a popular Tribal Dancing show. 

On the culture front, the city has several art museums , such as the Johannesburg Art Gallery , which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The Market Theatre complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays, and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The Joburg Theatre is South Africa's foremost "receiving house" of live entertainment—presenting world class theatre, both local and international. The suburbs of Melville , Newtown , Parkhurst , Norwood , Rosebank and Greenside are popular for their bohemian atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars. Nearby to these areas is the new up-coming area do Emmerentia best known for its parks and sleepy, trendy family-run restaurants such as D6 an award winning Cape-Malay themed restaurant and Industry a bakery that also specializes in gourmet burgers and milkshakes that is classed by Joburgers as having the best burger-milkshake combo in town. 

Shopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as Sandton City and Nelson Mandela Square , to various markets and flea markets , such as the Oriental Plaza and the Rosebank Flea Market ; the latter are popular for souvenirs and African Art . See above . (Cultural) tourists also visit the "Mai Mai Market" [71] ("Ezinyangeni" – the place of healers; located on the eastern wing of the city centre) dedicated to traditional herbs and traditional healers . 

The Cradle of Humankind a UNESCO World Heritage Site is 25 kilometres (16 mi) to the northwest of the city. The Sterkfontein fossil site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult Australopithecus africanus and the first near-complete skeleton of an early Australopithecine . Other attractions in this area include the Lesedi Cultural Village , while Magaliesburg and the Hartbeespoort Dam are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the origins of humankind in Africa , and houses an extensive collection of rock art . 

Johannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view wildlife . The Johannesburg Zoo is one of the largest in South Africa. The Lion Park nature reserve, near Lanseria , is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the Krugersdorp Nature Reserve , a 1500 ha game reserve , is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre [72] in the Magaliesberg runs a successful breeding program for cheetah , wild dog and other endangered species . The Rhino Lion Nature Reserve, [73] situated in the "Cradle of Humankind" on 1200 ha of "the typical highveld of Gauteng" also runs a breeding programme for endangered species including Bengal tigers, Siberian tigers and the extremely rare white lion . [ citation needed ] To the south, 11 km from the city centre, is the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve home to large mammals and hiking trails.

Johannesburg's most popular sports by participation are association football, cricket , rugby union , and running. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs. Football [ edit ] 

The city has several football clubs in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and the National First Division . In the PSL, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include Kaizer Chiefs (nicknamed Amakhosi ), Orlando Pirates (nicknamed the Buccaneers ), Moroka Swallows and Wits University (nicknamed the Clever Boys ). They are based at the city's FNB , Orlando , Dobsonville and Bidvest stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at Soccer City the venue of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. First Division teams are Jomo Cosmos and FC AK . Katlehong City and Alexandra United, play at Alexandra and Reiger Park stadium respectively. Cricket [ edit ] 

Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the Highveld Lions represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West Province at the Wanderers Stadium which was the venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final in which Australia successfully defended their title against India . Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever ODI match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs . They take part in the first class SuperSport Series , the one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Ram Slam T20 Challenge . Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 , in which India beat Pakistan in the final. Rugby [ edit ]

The M1 is one of the busiest highways in Johannesburg. The M2 in the afternoon as it passes through the Central Business District 

Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system.A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis. [ citation needed ] Airports [ edit ] 

Johannesburg is served principally by OR Tambo International Airport (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport ) for both domestic and international flights. Lanseria Airport , located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of Sandton , is used for commercial flights to Cape Town , Durban , Port Elizabeth , Botswana, and Sun City . Other airports include Rand Airport and Grand Central Airport . Rand Airport, located in Germiston , is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of South African Airways 's first Boeing 747 Classic , the Lebombo, which is now an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft. Roads [ edit ] Main article: Johannesburg freeways 

The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the Johannesburg Ring Road . The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an 80-kilometre (50 mi) loop around it: the N3 Eastern Bypass , which links Johannesburg with Durban ; the N1 Western Bypass , which links Johannesburg with Pretoria and Cape Town ; and the N12 Southern Bypass , which links Johannesburg with Witbank and Kimberley . The N3 was built exclusively with asphalt , while the N12 and N1 sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the R24 Airport Freeway intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere. [74] It is claimed [74] [75] that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa. 

Johannesburg has the most freeways connected to it. [ clarification needed ] It has the N1 , N3 , N12 , N14 , N17 , R21 , R24 and the R59 , all leading to Johannesburg. The M1 and M2 freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation. 

Johannesburg shares a network of metropolitan routes with Krugersdorp and Ekurhuleni . Taxis [ edit ] 

Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, metered taxis and minibus taxis . Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase use of metered taxis in the city. [ citation needed ] 

The minibus "taxis" are the de facto standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s The minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by turf wars . [ citation needed ] Mass transit [ edit ] 

The Metrorail Gauteng commuter rail system connects central Johannesburg to Soweto , Pretoria , and most of the satellite towns along the Witwatersrand . The railways transport huge numbers of commuters everyday. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of Sandton , Midrand , Randburg , and Rosebank , are served by the rapid rail link Gautrain . Trains [ edit ] Gautrain station at OR Tambo Airport 

A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, Gautrain has made provision for a rapid rail link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the OR Tambo International Airport . Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's Park Station (underground), Rosebank (underground), Sandton (underground), Marlboro (above-ground and raised), Midrand , Pretoria Station and Hatfield . There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via Rhodesfield (raised) and Marlboro. A 200 kilometer expansion is underway and wil consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, this may sound like an insignificant amount however it is expected to cost R18 billion and one line (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 6 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg. 

The east-west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , while the north–south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012. 

The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the N1 freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per day. [ citation needed ] An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977. [ citation needed ] 

In 2010, a high-speed rail link was proposed between Johannesburg and Durban . [76] However the cheapest option is still too expensive. Buses [ edit ] 

Johannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by Metrobus , a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by Volvo , Scania AB and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in Gandhi Square , where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk. Rea Vaya [ edit ] 

In 2010 in order to create an efficient public transport system the Rea Vaya bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have a large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/ scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount ( calculated according to distance approx $0.5 per 5 km). The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto Sandton and rosbank and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannsesburg with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion another expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. Education [ edit ] The University of the Witwatersrand 

Johannesburg has a well-developed higher education system of both private and public universities . Johannesburg is served by the public universities University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Johannesburg .

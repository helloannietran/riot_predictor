Clifford Glover was a 10-year-old black boy who was shot by Thomas Shea, a white on-duty, undercover policeman, on April 28, 1973. His death, and the policeman's later acquittal for a murder charge, led to riots in the South Jamaica section of Queens , New York . [1]

Shooting [ edit ] 

At 5 a.m. on April 28, 1973, 10-year-old Clifford Glover was shot when he and his stepfather were stopped by two undercover officers, Thomas Shea, and his partner Walter Scott. The two officers believed the boy and his stepfather were guilty of robbery. [1] [2] Glover and his stepfather were afraid of the two officers and ran from them, believing they themselves were about to be robbed. [1] 

Shea testified that he drew fire on the boy who appeared to have a weapon. Glover was hit by at least two bullets. [2] When Glover was hit, the officers claimed his father took the alleged weapon from him, which was never recovered. [1] According to Scott the boy told him "Fuck you, you're not taking me". [3] Rioting [ edit ] 

Immediately following the shooting, there were several days of riots in the South Jamaica neighborhood. At least 24 people, including 14 policemen, were injured; in addition, 25 protesters were arrested. [4] There were also smaller demonstrations accusing Shea of racism outside the courthouse during the trial. [1] The day after Shea was acquitted, hundreds of people began a riot, turning over cars, breaking windows, and stealing cash registers; one protestor was arrested in the aftermath [5] and rioters injured two police officers. [6] Trial [ edit ] 

Thomas Shea was put on trial for murder. The jury of 11 whites and one black acquitted Shea. He was the first New York City police officer ever to be tried for murder while on duty. [6] [7] Shea was declared not guilty on June 12, 1974. [1] Cultural impact [ edit ]

History [ edit ] 

Kaduna was founded by the British in 1913 and became the capital of Nigeria's former Northern Region in 1917. [2] It retained this status until 1967. Persons hailing from Kaduna include Dahiru Sadi , Tijani Babangida , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ("the underwear bomber"), Celestine Babayaro and Fiona Fullerton (British actress and former Bond girl ). The Nigerian Islamic umbrella association Jama’atu Nasril Islam is based in the city. [3] Religious strife [ edit ] Main article: 2000 Kaduna riots 

Due to its religious makeup, Kaduna has been the scene of religious tension between Muslims and Christians , particularly over the implementation of shari'a law in Kaduna State beginning in 2001. In February 2000, approximately 1,000 people were killed in a riot and several cars and houses were burned to ashes. The city remains segregated to this day, with Muslims living mainly in the north and Christians in the south. [4] Another incident in 2002 stemmed from an article in a Lagos newspaper that offended Muslims over the upcoming Miss World pageant scheduled for that week in the capital city of Abuja , suggesting that if Muhammad watched the beauty pageant he would end up marrying one of its contestants. A massive riot ensued. Churches were among the most frequently attacked targets: More than 20 were burned by Muslims. In retaliation, Christians burned eight mosques. Several hotels were also burned. The city suffered widespread damage, and 11,000 people were left homeless. In particular, the local offices of the newspaper that had published the offending article were torched. As a result, thousands of civilians fled the city to escape. Civil unrest soon spread to the capital, Abuja . After four days of rioting, Nigerian security forces quelled the riots and arrested hundreds of rioters. A temporary curfew was imposed, although individual killings continued. 215 bodies were counted on the streets or in morgues, while some others were buried by their families. 1,000 people were wounded. The funerals of many of the victims took place shortly after the riot ended. Muslim rioters were tried in Sharia courts, while Christian rioters were tried by civilian jurisdictions. The editor of the newspaper that had provoked the riots was arrested, and Isioma Daniel , the reporter who wrote the article, resigned and fled to Norway . [5] Kaduna was the place where Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the suspect of the terrorist attempt of arson on Northwest flight 253 in December 2009, grew up and returned to on vacation.

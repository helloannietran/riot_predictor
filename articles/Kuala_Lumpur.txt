Kuala Lumpur ( / ˈ k w ɑː l ə ˈ l ʊ m p ʊər / or / - p ər / ; Malaysian pronunciation: [ˈkwalə ˈlumpʊr] ), [6] officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur , is the national capital of Malaysia as well as its largest city. The city covers an area of 243 km 2 (94 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 1.7 million as of 2015 [update] . [7] Greater Kuala Lumpur , also known as the Klang Valley , is an urban agglomeration of 7.2 million people as of 2013 [update] . [8] It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in South-East Asia, in terms of population and economy. 

Kuala Lumpur is the seat of the Parliament of Malaysia . The city was once home to the executive and judicial branches of the federal government, but they were moved to Putrajaya in early 1999. [9] Some sections of the judiciary still remain in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. The official residence of the Malaysian King , the Istana Negara , is also situated in Kuala Lumpur. Rated as an alpha world city , Kuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of Malaysia due to its position as the capital as well as being a key city. 

Kuala Lumpur is one of three Federal Territories of Malaysia , [10] enclaved within the state of Selangor , on the central west coast of Peninsular Malaysia . [11] Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events including the 1998 Commonwealth Games and the Formula One Grand Prix. In addition, Kuala Lumpur is home to the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers , which have become an iconic symbol of Malaysia's futuristic development.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Kuala Lumpur Jamek Mosque at the confluence of Gombak (left) and Klang (right) rivers. The earliest settlement of Kuala Lumpur developed on the eastern side of the river bank (to the right in this picture). Etymology [ edit ] 

Kuala Lumpur means "muddy confluence"; kuala is the point where two rivers join together or an estuary, and lumpur means "mud". [12] [13] One suggestion is that it is named after Sungai Lumpur (River Lumpur); it was recorded in 1824 that Sungei Lumpoor was the most important tin-producing settlement up the Klang River . [14] Doubts however have been raised on such a derivation as Kuala Lumpur lies at the confluence of Gombak River and Klang River, therefore should rightly be named Kuala Gombak. [15] It has been argued by some that Sungai Lumpur is in fact Gombak River (therefore the point where it joined the Klang River would be Kuala Lumpur), [16] although Sungai Lumpur has also been suggested to be another river a mile upstream from the Gombak confluence. [15] 

It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur (a muddy landing place) but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur, while others suggest it was initially a Cantonese word lam-pa meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is however no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes. [16] [17] It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name. [15] Early years [ edit ] Historical affiliations

It is unknown who founded or named the settlement called Kuala Lumpur. Chinese miners were involved in tin mining up the Selangor River in the 1840s about ten miles north of present-day Kuala Lumpur, [15] and Mandailing Sumatrans led by Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa were also involved in tin mining and trade in the Ulu Klang region before 1860, and Sumatrans may have settled in the upper reaches of Klang River in the first quarter of the 19th century, possibly earlier. [16] [18] [19] Kuala Lumpur was originally a small hamlet of just a few houses and shops at the confluence of Sungai Gombak and Sungai Klang ( Klang River ) before it grew into a town. It is generally accepted that Kuala Lumpur become established as a town circa 1857, [20] when the Malay Chief of Klang , Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, aided by his brother Raja Juma'at of Lukut , raised funds to hire some Chinese miners from Lukut to open new tin mines here. [21] [22] The miners landed at Kuala Lumpur and continued their journey on foot to Ampang where the first mine was opened. [23] Kuala Lumpur was the furthest point up the Klang River to which supplies could conveniently be brought by boat; it therefore became a collection and dispersal point serving the tin mines. [15] [20] 

Although the early miners suffered a high death toll due to the malarial conditions of the jungle, the Ampang mines were successful, and the first tin from the mines was exported in 1859. [15] The tin-mining spurred the growth of the town, and miners later also settled in Pudu and Batu . The miners formed gangs among themselves; [24] there were the Hakka-dominated Hai San in Kuala Lumpur, and the Cantonese-dominated Ghee Hin based in Kanching in Ulu Selangor. Fights between different gangs were frequent in this period, mainly to gain control of the best tin mines. [25] Leaders of the Chinese community were conferred the title of Kapitan Cina (Chinese headman) by the Malay chief, and Hiu Siew, the owner of a mine in Lukut , was chosen as the first Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. [26] [27] As one of the first traders to arrive in Ampang (along with Yap Ah Sze), he sold provisions to the miners in exchange for tin. [28] 

Important Malay figures of early Kuala lumpur also include the Dato' Dagang ("chief of traders") and Haji Tahir. [18] The Minangkabaus were another important group of people in the early period; Minangkabau traders from Sumatra include Utsman Abdullah, [29] and Haji Mohamed Taib who was involved in the early development of Kampung Baru . [30] [31] The Minangkabaus are also important socio-religious figures, for example Utsman bin Abdullah was the first kadi of Kuala Lumpur as well as Muhammad Nur bin Ismail. [32] Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur [ edit ] Kapitan Yap Ah Loy , the third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur. Frank Swettenham , 

a contributor to the development of Kuala Lumpur. 

Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems – the buildings were made of wood and atap (palm frond thatching ) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroil in the Selangor Civil War due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur appointed in 1868, Yap Ah Loy , aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa also switched side to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground. Yap escaped to Klang where he reassembled a fighting force. Kuala Lumpur was recaptured by Yap in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang . [25] The war and other setbacks, such as a drop in tin prices, led to a slump, furthermore a major outbreak of cholera in late 1870s caused many to flee the town. The slump lasted until late 1879, when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover. [20] In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year. That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy . [33] [34] Yap, together with Frank Swettenham who was appointed the Resident in 1882, were the two most important figures of early Kuala Lumpur with Swettenham credited with its rapid growth and development and its transformation into a major urban center. [35] Sultan Abdul Samad Building , c.  1900 

The early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River – the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian Chettiars and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak ) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new police headquarter was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training. [36] The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square , would later become the centre of the British administrative offices when the colonial government offices were moved to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1897. [34] 

Frank Swettenham , on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets. He also stipulated that buildings should be constructed of brick and tile so that they would be less flammable, and that the town be rebuilt with wider streets to reduce fire risk. [35] [37] Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry for the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur; this place is the eponymous Brickfields . [38] Destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones, and many of the new brick buildings are characterised by the " five foot ways " as well as Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy expanded road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city; these roads include the main arterial routes of the present Ampang Road , Pudu Road and Petaling Street . [39] As Chinese Kapitan , he was vested with wide powers on a par with Malay community leaders. Law reforms were implemented and new legal measures introduced to the assembly. Yap also presided over a small claims court . With a police force of six, he was able to uphold the rule of law, constructing a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad held an interest. [40] Headquarters of the F.M.S. Railways at Kuala Lumpur - c.  1910 . The Sultan Abdul Samad Building is located further down the road beyond the headquarters. 

A railway line between Kuala Lumpur and Klang, initiated by Swettenham and completed in 1886, increased accessibility which resulted in the rapid growth of the town. The population grew from 4,500 in 1884 to 20,000 in 1890. [20] As development intensified in the 1880s, it also put pressure on sanitation, waste disposal and other health issues. A Sanitary Board was created on 14 May 1890 which was responsible for sanitation, upkeep of roads, lighting of street and other functions. This would eventually become the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council . [41] In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States . [42] 20th century–present [ edit ] 

The area that is defined as Kuala Lumpur expanded considerably in the 20th century. It was only 0.65 km 2 in 1895, but was extended to encompass 20 km 2 in 1903. By the time it became a municipality in 1948 it had expanded to 93 km 2 , and then to 243 km 2 in 1974 as a Federal Territory. [43] 

The development of the rubber industry in Selangor in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920. [44] Previously the commercial activities of Kuala Lumpur were run to a large extent by Chinese businessmen such as Loke Yew who was then the richest and most influential Chinese of Kuala Lumpur. The growth of the rubber industry led to an influx of foreign capital and planters, with new companies and industries becoming established in Kuala Lumpur, and other companies previously based in Singapore and elsewhere also found a presence here. [44] Japanese troops advancing up High Street (now Jalan Tun H S Lee ) in Kuala Lumpur in December 1941 during World War II . 

During World War II , Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishirō Itagaki , surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . [45] Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency , during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city. [35] In 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule. [46] The ceremony for the Declaration of Independence was held at the Merdeka Stadium by the first Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman . Kuala Lumpur remained the capital after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament was completed at the edge of the Lake Gardens in 1963. [47] The Majestic Theatre on Pudu Road was an early pioneer in Kuala Lumpur's cinema scene. It was converted into an amusement park in the 1990s and demolished in 2009. 

Kuala Lumpur had seen a number of civil disturbances over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair that began with the confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. [48] The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. [49] The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people, [49] and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities. 

Kuala Lumpur achieved city status in 1972, [50] becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence. Later, on 1 February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory . [51] Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital. [52] On 14 May 1990, Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council. The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory, as well as the seat of the federal government. [53] The administrative and judicial functions of the government were shifted from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya. Kuala Lumpur however still retained its legislative function , [54] and remained the home of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Constitutional King). [55] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Kuala Lumpur A satellite view of Kuala Lumpur The city centre in 2015. 

The geography of Kuala Lumpur is characterised by the huge Klang Valley . The valley is bordered by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east, several minor ranges in the north and the south and the Strait of Malacca in the west. Kuala Lumpur is a Malay term that translates to "muddy confluence" as it is located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers. [56] 

Located in the centre of Selangor state, Kuala Lumpur was previously under the rule of Selangor State Government. In 1974, Kuala Lumpur was separated from Selangor to form the first Federal Territory governed directly by the Malaysian Federal Government. Its location on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia , which has wider flat land than the east coast, has contributed to its faster development relative to other cities in Malaysia. [57] The municipality of the city covers an area of 243 km 2 (94 sq mi), [2] with an average elevation of 81.95 m (268.9 ft). [58] Climate and weather [ edit ] 

Protected by the Titiwangsa Mountains in the east and Indonesia's Sumatra Island in the west, Kuala Lumpur has a tropical rainforest climate ( Köppen climate classification Af ), which is warm and sunny, along with abundant rainfall, especially during the northeast monsoon season from October to March. Temperatures tend to remain constant. Maximums hover between 32 and 33 °C (90 and 91 °F) and have never exceeded 38.5 °C (101.3 °F), while minimums hover between 23.4 and 24.6 °C (74.1 and 76.3 °F) and have never fallen below 14.4 °C (57.9 °F). [59] [60] Kuala Lumpur typically receives minimum 2,600 mm (100 in) of rain annually; June and July are relatively dry, but even then rainfall typically exceeds 131 millimetres (5.2 in) per month. 

Flooding is a frequent occurrence in Kuala Lumpur whenever there is a heavy downpour, especially in the city centre and downstream areas. [61] Smoke from forest fires of nearby Sumatra sometimes cast a haze over the region. It is a major source of pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.

Kuala Lumpur was administered by a corporation sole called the Federal Capital Commissioner from 1 April 1961, until it was awarded city status in 1972, after which executive power transferred to the Lord Mayor ( Datuk Bandar ). [65] Nine mayors have been appointed since then. The current mayor is Mhd Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz , who has been in office since 18 July 2015. [66] Local government [ edit ] 

The local administration is carried out by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall , an agency under the Federal Territories Ministry of Malaysia . [65] It is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. Executive power lies with the mayor in the city hall, who is appointed for three years by the Federal Territories Minister. This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970. [67] Districts [ edit ] Districts (divisions) of Kuala Lumpur

Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding urban areas form the most industrialised and economically, the fastest growing region in Malaysia. [69] Despite the relocation of federal government administration to Putrajaya , certain government institutions such as Bank Negara Malaysia ( National Bank of Malaysia ), Companies Commission of Malaysia and Securities Commission as well as most embassies and diplomatic missions have remained in the city. [70] 

The city remains as the economic and business centre of the country. Kuala Lumpur is a centre for finance, insurance, real estate, media and the arts of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is rated as an alpha world city , and is the only global city in Malaysia, according to the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). [71] The infrastructure development in the surrounding areas such as the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at Sepang , the creation of the Multimedia Super Corridor and the expansion of Port Klang further reinforce the economic significance of the city.

Bursa Malaysia or the Malaysia Exchange is based in the city and forms one of its core economic activities. As of 5 July 2013, the market capitalisation stood at US$505.67 billion. [72] 

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Kuala Lumpur is estimated at RM73,536 million in 2008 with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent. [73] [74] The per capita GDP for Kuala Lumpur in 2013 is RM79,752 with an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent. [75] The total employment in Kuala Lumpur is estimated at around 838,400. [76] The service sector comprising finance, insurance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, utilities, personal services and government services form the largest component of employment representing about 83.0 percent of the total. [76] The remaining 17 percent comes from manufacturing and construction. 

The average monthly household income for Kuala Lumpur was RM4,105 (USD 1,324) in 1999, up from RM3,371 (USD 1,087) four years prior, making it 66% higher than the national average. [77] In terms of household income distribution, 23.5% of households in the city earned more than RM5,000 (USD 1,613) per month compared to 9.8% for the entire country, while 8.1% earned less than RM1,000 (USD 323) a month. [77] Pre-war terraced houses refurbished into restaurants and bars along Tengkat Tong Shin in Bukit Bintang 

The large service sector is evident in the number of local and foreign banks and insurance companies operating in the city. Kuala Lumpur is poised to become the global Islamic Financing hub [78] with an increasing number of financial institutions providing Islamic Financing and the strong presence of Gulf's financial institutions such as the world's largest Islamic bank, Al-Rajhi Bank [79] and Kuwait Finance House . Apart from that, the Dow Jones Company is keen to work with Bursa Malaysia to set up Islamic Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs), which would help raise Malaysia's profile in the Gulf. [80] The city has a large number of foreign corporations and is also host to many multi national companies' regional offices or support centres, particularly for finance and accounting, and information technology functions. Most of the countries' largest companies have their headquarters based here and as of December 2007 and excluding Petronas , there are 14 companies that are listed in Forbes 2000 based in Kuala Lumpur. [81] Moonrise over Kuala Lumpur 

Other important economic activities in the city are education and health services. Kuala Lumpur also has advantages stemming from the high concentration of educational institutions that provide a wide-ranging of courses. Numerous public and private medical specialist centres and hospitals in the city offer general health services, and a wide range of specialist surgery and treatment that caters to locals and tourists. 

There has been growing emphasis to expand the economic scope of the city into other service activities, such as research and development, which supports the rest of the economy of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has been home for years to important research centres such as the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, the Forest Research Institute Malaysia and the Institute of Medical Research [82] and more research centres are expected to be established in the coming years. Tourism [ edit ] Petaling Street , Kuala Lumpur's bustling Chinatown 

Tourism plays an important role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic . Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world , with 8.9 million tourists per year. [83] [84] Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions — has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000m2-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. [85] Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city. Jamek Mosque built in 1907 

The major tourist destinations in Kuala Lumpur include the Merdeka Square , the House of Parliament , the Petaling Street , the National Palace ( Istana Negara ), the Kuala Lumpur Tower , the National Museum , the Central Market , Kuala Lumpur City Gallery , the National Monument , and religious sites such as the Jamek Mosque . [86] Kuala Lumpur plays host to many cultural festivals such as the Thaipusam procession at the Sri Mahamariamman Temple . Every year during the Thaipusam celebration, a silver chariot carrying the statue of Lord Muruga together with his consort Valli and Teivayanni would be paraded through the city beginning at the temple all the way to Batu Caves in the neighboring Selangor . [87] 

The entertainment hub of the city is mainly centred in the Golden Triangle encompassing Jalan P. Ramlee , Jalan Sultan Ismail and Ampang Road. Trendy nightclubs , bars and lounges , such as the Beach Club, Espanda, the Hakka Republic Wine Bar Restaurant, Hard Rock Cafe , the Luna Bar, Nuovo, Rum Jungle, the Thai Club, Zouk , and many others are located here. Retail [ edit ] Suria KLCC, located between the Petronas Twin Towers Further information: Shopping in Kuala Lumpur and Bukit Bintang 

Kuala Lumpur alone has 66 shopping malls and is the retail and fashion hub for Malaysia. [88] Shopping in Malaysia contributed RM7.7 billion (USD 2.26 billion) or 20.8 percent of the RM31.9 billion tourism receipts in 2006. [89] 

Suria KLCC is one of Malaysia's premier shopping destinations due to its location beneath the Petronas Twin Towers . Bukit Bintang , Kuala Lumpur retail cluster 

Apart from Suria KLCC, Bukit Bintang district has the highest concentration of shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur. It includes: Pavilion, Fahrenheit 88, Plaza Low Yat, Berjaya Times Square, Lot 10, BB Plaza, Sungai Wang Plaza.

Apart from shopping complexes, Kuala Lumpur has designated numerous zones in the city to market locally manufactured products such as textiles , fabrics and handicrafts . The Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur, commonly known as Petaling Street , is one of them. Chinatown features many pre-independence buildings with Straits Chinese and colonial architectural influences. [90] [91] 

In 2000, the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism introduced the mega sale event for shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event is held three times a year — in March, May and December — during which all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination.

Kuala Lumpur is the most populous city in Malaysia, with a population of 1.7 million in the city proper as of 2015 [update] . [5] It has a population density of 6,696 inhabitants per square kilometre (17,340/sq mi), and is the most densely populated administrative district in Malaysia. [2] Residents of the city are colloquially known as KLites . [94] Kuala Lumpur is also the centre of the wider Klang Valley conurbation (covering Petaling Jaya , Klang , Subang Jaya , Shah Alam , Gombak and others) which has an estimated metropolitan population of 7.2 million as of 2012 [update] . [8] 

Kuala Lumpur's heterogeneous populace includes the country's three major ethnic groups: the Malays , the Chinese and the Indians , although the city also has a mix of different cultures including Eurasians , as well as Kadazans , Ibans and other indigenous races from East Malaysia and Peninsula Malaysia . [76] [95] 

Historically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, with the Kuala Lumpur of 1872 (before its destruction in the Selangor Civil War) beside the Klang River described by Frank Swettenham as a "purely Chinese village", although a Malay stockade already existed at Bukit Nanas at that time. By 1875 Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn. [18] More recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. Large number of Malays now considered Bumiputra were originally from the Indonesian archipelago – the Minangkabaus , Javanese , and Buginese began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the Acehnese arrived in the late 20th century. [96] Some Pahang Malays who fought in the Selangor Civil War in 1873 also chose to settle in Kuala Lumpur after the war. The population of Kuala Lumpur was estimated to be around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor. [97] In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and Klang . [20] 

A census in 1891 of uncertain accuracy gave a figure of 43,796 inhabitants, 79% of whom were Chinese (71% of the Chinese were Hakka ), 14% Malay, and 6% Indian. [97] Another estimate put the population of Kuala Lumpur in 1890 at 20,000. [20] In 1931, 61% of Kuala Lumpur's 111,418 inhabitants were Chinese, [98] and in 1947 63.5%. The Malays however began to settle in the Kuala Lumpur in significant numbers, in part due to government employment, as well as the expansion of the city that absorbed the surrounding rural areas where many Malays lived. Between 1947 and 1957 the population of Malays in Kuala Lumpur doubled, increasing from 12.5 to 15%, while the proportion of Chinese dropped. [99] The process continued after Malayan independence with the growth of a largely Malay civil service, and later the implementation of the New Economic Policy which encouraged Malay participation in urban industries and business. In 1980 the population of Kuala Lumpur had reached over a million, [43] with 52% Chinese, 33% Malay, and 15% Indian. [100] From 1980 to 2000 the number of Bumiputras increased by 77%, but the Chinese still outnumbered the Bumiputras in Kuala Lumpur in the 2000 census at 43% compared to Bumiputras at 38%. [76] [101] By the 2010 census, according to the Department of Statistics and excluding non-citizens, the percentage of the Bumiputera population in Kuala Lumpur has reached around 45.9%, with the Chinese population at 43.2% and Indians 10.3%. [93] 

A notable phenomenon in recent times has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. [76] [93] These figures also do not include a significant number of illegal immigrants . [102] Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia , Nepal , Burma , Thailand , Bangladesh , India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Philippines , and Vietnam into Malaysia , many of whom enter the country illegally or without proper permits. [103] [104] Clockwise from top left: Masjid Negara , Thean Hou Temple , Sri Mahamariamman Temple , St. John's Cathedral 

Birth rates in Kuala Lumpur have declined and resulted in the lower proportion of young people – the proportion of those in the below 15 years old category fell from 33% in 1980 to slightly less than 27% in 2000. [76] On the other hand, the working age group of 15–59 increased from 63% in 1980 to 67% in 2000. [76] The elderly age group, 60 years old and above has increased from 4% in 1980 and 1991 to 6% in 2000. [76] 

Kuala Lumpur is pluralistic and religiously diverse. The city has many places of worship catering to the multi-religious population. Islam is practised primarily by the Malays and the Indian Muslim communities. Buddhism , Confucianism and Taoism are practised mainly among the Chinese. Indians traditionally adhere to Hinduism. Some Chinese and Indians also subscribe to Christianity . [105] 

As of 2010 [update] Census the population of Kuala Lumpur is 46.4% Muslim , 35.7% Buddhist, 8.5% Hindu , 5.8% Christian , 1.1% Taoist or Chinese religion adherent, 2.0% follower of other religions, and 0.5% non-religious. 

Bahasa Malaysia is the principal language in Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur residents are generally literate in English, with a large proportion adopting it as their first language. [106] It has a strong presence, especially in business and is a compulsory language taught in schools. [95] Cantonese and Mandarin are prominent as they are spoken by the local majority Chinese population. [107] Another major dialect spoken is Hakka . While Tamil is dominant amongst the local Indian population, other Indian languages spoken include Telugu , Malayalam , Punjabi and Hindi . [108] Beside the Malay language, there are a variety of languages spoken by people of Indonesian descent, such as Minangkabau [109] and Javanese . Cityscape [ edit ] The view of Kuala Lumpur from Titiwangsa Lake Garden Architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of Kuala Lumpur The Kuala Lumpur Railway Station (right) contrasts with a Keretapi Tanah Melayu (left) Administration Building darker, similarly Mughal-styled building. Both designed by A. B. Hubback 

The architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a mixture of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern , and postmodern architecture mix. [110] Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok , Jakarta and Manila , most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles – Mughal / Moorish Revival , Mock Tudor , Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. [111] Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque . The Kuala Lumpur Tower 

Prior to the Second World War , many shophouses , usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. [90] [91] Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown , Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman , Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas. The Petronas Twin Towers at dusk 

Independence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris . Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings. [112] Examples of these buildings are Menara Telekom , Menara Maybank , Dayabumi Complex , and the Islamic Centre. [113] Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret , when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge. The 452-metre (1,483 ft) tall Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest twin buildings in the world. [114] They were designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art. [115] 

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Twin Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre . Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat , Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 metres with a combined height of 34,035 metres from its 244 high rise buildings. [116] Parks [ edit ] KLCC Park 

The Lake Gardens , a 92-hectare (230-acre) botanical garden, is the first recreational park created in Kuala Lumpur.

The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport , also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, [156] and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia . KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres a airport rail link service from KL Sentral , which takes twenty-eight minutes, [157] while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour.

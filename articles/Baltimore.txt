Baltimore ( / ˈ b ɔː l t ᵻ ˌ m ɔːr / , locally: [ˈbɔɫ.mɔɻ] ) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Maryland , and the 29th-most populous city in the country. It was established by the Constitution of Maryland [9] and is not part of any county; thus, it is the largest independent city in the United States. Baltimore has more public monuments per capita than any other city in the country and is home to some of the earliest National Register historic districts in the nation, including Fell's Point (1969), Federal Hill (1970) and Mount Vernon Place (1971). More than 65,000 properties, or roughly one in three buildings in the city, are listed on the National Register , more than any other city in the nation. [10] [11] 

Founded in 1729, Baltimore is the second largest seaport in the Mid-Atlantic . [12] Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States and a major manufacturing center. [13] After a decline in major manufacturing, industrialization and rail transportation, Baltimore shifted to a service-oriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital (founded 1889), and Johns Hopkins University (founded 1876), now the city's top two employers. [14] 

Baltimore had a population of 621,849 in 2015; in 2010, that of Baltimore Metropolitan Area was 2.7 million, the 21st largest in the country. [15] [16] 

With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore has been dubbed "a city of neighborhoods". Famous residents have included the writers Edgar Allan Poe , Edith Hamilton , Frederick Douglass , and H.L. Mencken ; jazz musician James "Eubie" Blake ; singer Billie Holiday ; actor and filmmaker John Waters ; and baseball player Babe Ruth . In the War of 1812 , Francis Scott Key wrote The Star-Spangled Banner , later the American national anthem , in the city. [17]

History [ edit ] See also: History of Baltimore and Timeline of Baltimore 

The city has 289 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 

The historical records of the government of Baltimore are located at the Baltimore City Archives . Etymology [ edit ] 

The city is named after Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore , [18] (1605–1675), [19] of the Irish House of Lords and founding proprietor of the Province of Maryland . [20] [21] Baltimore Manor was the name of the estate in County Longford on which the Calvert family lived in Ireland. [21] [22] Baltimore is an anglicization of the Irish name Baile an Tí Mhóir , meaning "town of the big house." [21] 17th century [ edit ] 

In 1608, Captain John Smith traveled 210 miles from Jamestown to the uppermost Chesapeake Bay , leading the first European expedition to the Patapsco River [23] The name "Patapsco" is derived from pota-psk-ut , which translates to "backwater" or "tide covered with froth" in Algonquian dialect. [24] A quarter century after John Smith's voyage, English colonists began to settle in Maryland. The area constituting the modern City of Baltimore and its metropolitan area was first settled by David Jones in 1661. He claimed the area known today as Harbor East on the east bank of the Jones Falls stream, which flows south into Baltimore's Inner Harbor . [25] 

In the early 1600s, the immediate Baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated, if at all, by Native Americans . The Baltimore County area northward was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannocks living in the lower Susquehanna River valley who "controlled all of the upper tributaries of the Chesapeake" but "refrained from much contact with Powhatan in the Potomac region." [26] Pressured by the Susquehannocks, the Piscataway tribe of Algonquians stayed well south of the Baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the Potomac River in what is now Charles and southern Prince George's south of the Fall Line . [27] [28] [29] The Baltimore area had been inhabited by Native Americans since at least the 10th millennium BC , when Paleo-Indians first settled in the region. One Paleo-Indian site and several Archaic period and Woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in Baltimore, including four from the Late Woodland period . [30] During the Late Woodland period, the archaeological culture that is called the "Potomac Creek complex" resided in the area from Baltimore to the Rappahannock River in Virginia . [31] 

The current Baltimore on the Patapsco River was established in 1729, but an earlier Baltimore existed on the Bush River as early as 1674, The first county seat of Baltimore County is known today as "Old Baltimore". It was located on the Bush River on land that in 1773 became part of Harford County. In 1674, the General Assembly passed "An Act for erecting [sic] a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province." The site of the court house and jail for Baltimore County was evidently "Old Baltimore" near the Bush River. We know this because in 1683, the General Assembly passed "An Act for Advancement of Trade" to "establish towns, ports, and places of trade, within the province." One of the towns established by the act in Baltimore County was "on Bush River, on Town Land, near the Court-House." The court house on the Bush River referenced in the 1683 Act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 Act. "Old Baltimore" was in existence as early as 1674, but we don't know with certainty what if anything happened on the site prior to that year. The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost for years. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG), a U.S. Army testing facility. APG’s Cultural Resource Management Program took up the task of finding Old Baltimore. The firm of R. Christopher Goodwin Associates (Goodwin) was contracted for the project. After Goodwin first performed historical and archival work, they coordinated their work with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel went in with Goodwin to defuse any unexploded ordnance. The field team worked from fall 1997 through winter 1998. The team dug 420 test pits, and they uncovered several artifacts...." [32] [33] [34] 18th and 19th centuries [ edit ] 

The colonial General Assembly of Maryland created the Port of Baltimore at old Whetstone Point (now Locust Point ) in 1706 for the tobacco trade. The Town of Baltimore was founded and laid out shortly thereafter on July 30, 1729, and is named after Lord Baltimore (Cecilius Calvert), who was the first Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland . Cecilius Calvert was the oldest son of Sir George Calvert , (1579–1632), who became the First Lord Baltimore of County Longford , Ireland in 1625. Previously, he had been a loyal agent of King Charles I of England (1600–1649) as his Secretary of State until declaring himself a follower of Roman Catholicism . Regardless, the King still gave his heir Cecil the 1632 grant for the Maryland colony. The colony was a followup to his earlier settlement in Newfoundland , known as "Acadia" or "Avalon", (future Canada ), which he found too cold and difficult for habitation. [35] 

Baltimore grew swiftly in the 18th Century as a granary for sugar-producing colonies in the Caribbean . The profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food. [36] It was also during this time when Baltimore saw the establishment of its public market system in 1763. [37] Lexington Market , founded in 1782, continues to be known as one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in the United States today. [38] Other firsts include: the first Post Office System in the United States (inaugurated in 1774) [39] and the first water company chartered in the United States (Baltimore Water Company, 1792). [40] [41] Baltimore Town in 1752, (at "The Basin") 

Baltimore played a key part in events leading to and including the American Revolution . City leaders such as Jonathan Plowman Jr. moved the city to join the resistance to British taxes, and merchants signed agreements to not trade with Britain. [42] The Second Continental Congress met in the Henry Fite House from December 1776 to February 1777, effectively making the city the capital of the United States during this period. [43] After the Revolutionary war, the Town of Baltimore, nearby Jonestown , and an area known as Fells Point were incorporated as the City of Baltimore in 1796–1797. The city remained a part of surrounding Baltimore County , where it had also served as the " county seat " since 1768, until 1851 when it was made an independent city , with the same status in state government as the other 23 counties of Maryland. [44] 

The city was the site of the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812 . After burning Washington, D.C. , the British attacked Baltimore outside the eastern outskirts of town on the "Patapsco Neck" on September 12, at the Battle of North Point , then on the night of September 13–14, 1814. United States forces from Fort McHenry successfully defended the city's harbor from the British. Francis Scott Key , (1779–1843), a Maryland lawyer from Georgetown and Frederick , was aboard a British ship where he had been negotiating for the release of an American prisoner, Dr. William Beanes . Sixth Regiment fighting railroad strikers, July 20, 1877 [45] 

Key witnessed the bombardment from this ship and after seeing the huge American flag on the morning of September 14, 1814, he wrote " The Star-Spangled Banner ", a poem recounting the attack. Key's poem was set to a 1780 tune by British composer John Stafford Smith , and "The Star-Spangled Banner" became the official national anthem of the United States in 1931. The Battle Monument commemorates the Battle of Baltimore . This monument is the official emblem of the City of Baltimore. 

Following the Battle of Baltimore, the city's population grew rapidly and was the first American city to illuminate its streets with hydrogen gas in 1816. The construction of the federally funded National Road (which later became part of U.S. Route 40 ) and the private Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B. O.) made Baltimore a major shipping and manufacturing center by linking the city with major markets in the Midwest . A distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker "The Monumental City" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President John Quincy Adams . At an evening function Adams gave the following toast: "Baltimore: the Monumental City—May the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant." [46] Baltimore suffered one of the worst riots of the antebellum South in 1835, when bad investments led to the Baltimore bank riot . [47] Soon after the city pioneered in creating the world's first dental college the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 1840, and sharing Samuel Morse's invention of the world's first telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington DC in 1844. 

Maryland remained part of the Union during the American Civil War despite being a slave state , in addition to popular support for secession in its southern and eastern regions, along with Baltimore, all of which benefited greatly from both the tobacco and slave trades. [48] [49] When Union soldiers from the Sixth Massachusetts state militia and some unarmed Pennsylvania state militia known as the "Washington Brigade" from Philadelphia with their band marched through the city at the start of the war, Confederate sympathizers attacked the troops, which led to the first bloodshed in the Civil War during the Baltimore riot of 1861 . Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot, which caused Union troops to later occupy Baltimore in May under Gen. Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts. Maryland came under direct federal administration—in part, to prevent the state from seceding—until the end of the war in April 1865. 

In the midst of the Long Depression , which followed the Panic of 1873 , the Baltimore Ohio Railroad company attempted to lower its workers' wages, leading to strikes and riots in Baltimore, as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 . On July 20, 1877, Maryland Governor John Lee Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the National Guard to end the strikes, which had disrupted train service at Cumberland in western Maryland. Citizens sympathetic to the railroad workers attacked the National Guard troops as they marched from their armories in Baltimore to Camden Station . Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired on the crowd, killing 10 and wounding 25. Rioters then damaged B O trains and burned portions of the rail station. Order was restored in the city on July 21–22 when federal troops arrived to protect railroad property and end the strike. [50] 20th century [ edit ] The Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, looking west from Pratt and Gay streets 

On February 7, 1904, the Great Baltimore Fire destroyed over 1,500 buildings in 30 hours, leaving more than 70 blocks of the downtown area burned to the ground. Damages were estimated at $150 million—in 1904 dollars. [51] As the city rebuilt during the next two years, lessons learned from the fire led to improvements in firefighting equipment standards. [52] 

The city grew in area by annexing new suburbs from the surrounding counties, the last being in 1918, when the city acquired portions of Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County . [53] A state constitutional amendment, approved in 1948, required a special vote of the citizens in any proposed annexation area, effectively preventing any future expansion of the city's boundaries. [54] 

The relative size of the city's black population grew from 23.8% in 1950 to 46.4% in 1970. [55] The Baltimore riot of 1968 occurred following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee , on April 4, 1968. Coinciding with riots in other cities , public order was not restored until April 12, 1968. The Baltimore riot cost the city of Baltimore an estimated $10 million (US$ 68 million in 2016). A total of 11,000 Maryland National Guard and federal troops were ordered into the city. [56] 

Lasting effects of the riot can be seen on the streets of North Avenue , Howard Street , Gay Street , and Pennsylvania Avenue , where long stretches of the streets remain barren. [57] The city experienced challenges again in 1974 when teachers, municipal workers , and police officers conducted strikes. [58] 

By the beginning of the 1970s, Baltimore's downtown area known as the Inner Harbor had been neglected and was occupied by a collection of abandoned warehouses. The nickname "Charm City" came from a 1975 meeting of advertisers seeking to improve the city's reputation. [59] [60] Efforts to redevelop the area started with the construction of the Maryland Science Center , which opened in 1976, the Baltimore World Trade Center (1977), and the Baltimore Convention Center (1979). Harborplace , an urban retail and restaurant complex, opened on the waterfront in 1980, followed by the National Aquarium , Maryland's largest tourist destination, and the Baltimore Museum of Industry in 1981. During the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in the United States , Baltimore City Health Department official Robert Mehl persuaded the city's mayor to form a committee to address food problems; the Baltimore-based charity Moveable Feast grew out of this initiative in 1990. [61] [62] [63] By 2010, the organization's region of service had expanded from merely Baltimore to include all of the Eastern Shore of Maryland . [64] In 1992, the Baltimore Orioles baseball team moved from Memorial Stadium to Oriole Park at Camden Yards , located downtown near the harbor. Pope John Paul II held an open-air mass at Camden Yards during his papal visit to the United States in October 1995. Three years later the Baltimore Ravens football team moved into M T Bank Stadium next to Camden Yards. [65] 21st century [ edit ] 

In January 2004, the historic Hippodrome Theatre reopened after significant renovation as part of the France-Merrick Performing Arts Center. [66] The Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History Culture opened in 2005 on the northeast corner of President Street and East Pratt Street, and the National Slavic Museum in Fell's Point was established in 2012. On April 12, 2012, Johns Hopkins held a dedication ceremony to mark the completion of one of the United States' largest medical complexes – the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore – which features the Sheikh Zayed Cardiovascular and Critical Care Tower and The Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center. The event, held at the entrance to the $1.1 billion 1.6 million-square-foot-facility, honored the many donors including Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan , first president of the United Arab Emirates , and Michael Bloomberg . [67] [68] 

Maryland's Star-Spangled 200 celebration, launched as the "Star-Spangled Sailabration" and crescendo "Star-Spangled Spectacular" festivals, was a three-year commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812 and the penning of The Star-Spangled Banner . The Star-Spangled Sailabration festival brought a total of 45 tall ships, naval vessels and others from the US, United Kingdom, Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico to Baltimore's Harbor. The event, held June 13–19, 2012, was the week encompassing Flag Day and the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of War. [69] [70] The Star-Spangled Spectacular was a 10-day free festival that celebrated the 200th anniversary of the United States National Anthem from September 6–16, 2014. More than 30 naval vessels and tall ships from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Norway, Germany, Spain and Turkey berthed at the Inner Harbor, Fell's Point and North Locust Point. An air show from the Navy's Flight Demonstration Team, the Blue Angels performed during both festivals. Special guests such as President Barack Obama , Vice President Joe Biden , and Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus , were in attendance at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine . [71] During the course of the Star-Spangled 200 celebration the city was showcased on three separate live television broadcasts. Visit Baltimore CEO, Tom Noonan, was quoted in the Baltimore Sun as calling the Spectacular, "the largest tourism event in our city's history." Over a million people visited Baltimore during both festivals. [72] 

Following the Death of Freddie Gray in April 2015, the city experienced major protests and international media attention, which resulted in a temporary curfew being enforced, as well as a drastic rise in murders. [73] On September 19, 2016 the Baltimore City Council approved a $660 million bond deal for the $5.5 billion Port Covington redevelopment project championed by Under Armour founder Kevin Plank and his real estate company Sagamore Development. Port Covington surpassed the Harbor Point development as the largest tax-increment financing deal in Baltimore’s history and it's among the largest urban redevelopment projects in the country. [74] The waterfront development that includes the new headquarters for Under Armour, as well as shops, housing, offices, and manufacturing spaces is projected to create 26,500 permanent jobs with a $4.3 billion annual economic impact. [75] In an open letter Plank refers to the turbulent history in Baltimore's economic development and civic life as "forks in the road." He concludes by saying "we saw one of those great forks in the road, and chose the best course" with Port Covington. [76] Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake led the signing of three bills that commit the city to the sale of bonds over the next 15 to 20 years to fund the infrastructure for the Port Covington development on September 28, 2016. [77] Geography [ edit ] 

Baltimore is in north-central Maryland on the Patapsco River close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay . The city is also located on the fall line between the Piedmont Plateau and the Atlantic Coastal Plain , which divides Baltimore into "lower city" and "upper city". The city's elevation ranges from sea level at the harbor to 480 feet (150 m) in the northwest corner near Pimlico . [5] 

According to the 2010 Census, the city has a total area of 92.1 square miles (239 km 2 ), of which 80.9 sq mi (210 km 2 ) is land and 11.1 sq mi (29 km 2 ) is water. [4] The total area is 12.1 percent water. 

Baltimore is almost completely surrounded by Baltimore County, but is politically independent of it. It is bordered by Anne Arundel County to the south. Cityscape [ edit ] Inner Harbor Panorama.

Baltimore exhibits examples from each period of architecture over more than two centuries, and work from many famous architects such as Benjamin Latrobe , George A. Frederick , John Russell Pope , Mies van der Rohe and I. M. Pei . 

The city is rich in architecturally significant buildings in a variety of styles. The Baltimore Basilica (1806–1821) is a neoclassical design by Benjamin Latrobe, and also the oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States. In 1813 Robert Cary Long, Sr., built for Rembrandt Peale the first substantial structure in the United States designed expressly as a museum. Restored, it is now the Municipal Museum of Baltimore, or popularly the Peale Museum . 

The McKim Free School was founded and endowed by John McKim, although the building was erected by his son Isaac in 1822 after a design by William Howard and William Small. It reflects the popular interest in Greece when the nation was securing its independence, as well as a scholarly interest in recently published drawings of Athenian antiquities. 

The Phoenix Shot Tower (1828), at 234.25 feet (71.40 m) tall, was the tallest building in the United States until the time of the Civil War. It was constructed without the use of exterior scaffolding. The Sun Iron Building, designed by R.C. Hatfield in 1851, was the city's first iron-front building and was a model for a whole generation of downtown buildings. Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church , built in 1870 in memory of financier George Brown , has stained glass windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany and has been called "one of the most significant buildings in this city, a treasure of art and architecture" by Baltimore Magazine . [78] [79] 

The 1845 Greek Revival -style Lloyd Street Synagogue is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States . The Johns Hopkins Hospital , designed by Lt. Col. John S. Billings in 1876, was a considerable achievement for its day in functional arrangement and fireproofing. 

I.M. Pei's World Trade Center (1977) is the tallest equilateral pentagonal building in the world at 405 feet (123 m) tall. 

The Inner Harbor East area has seen the addition of two new towers which have completed construction: a 24-floor tower that is the new world headquarters of Legg Mason , and a 21-floor Four Seasons Hotel complex. 

The streets of Baltimore are organized in a grid pattern , lined with tens of thousands of brick and formstone -faced rowhouses . In The Baltimore Rowhouse , Mary Ellen Hayward and Charles Belfoure considered the rowhouse as the architectural form defining Baltimore as "perhaps no other American city." [80] In the mid-1790s, developers began building entire neighborhoods of the British-style rowhouses, which became the dominant house type of the city early in the 19th century. [81] 

Formstone facings, now a common feature on Baltimore rowhouses, were an addition patented in 1937 by Albert Knight. John Waters characterized formstone as "the polyester of brick" in a 30-minute documentary film, Little Castles: A Formstone Phenomenon . [82] 

Oriole Park at Camden Yards is considered by many to be the most beautiful baseball park in Major League Baseball, and has inspired many other cities to build their own versions of this retro style ballpark. Camden Yards along with the National Aquarium have helped revive the Inner Harbor from what once was an industrial district full of dilapidated warehouses into a bustling commercial district full of bars, restaurants and retail establishments. Today, the Inner Harbor boasts the highest, most desirable real estate in the Mid-Atlantic. [83] 

Baltimore's newly rehabilitated Everyman Theatre was honored by the Baltimore Heritage at the 2013 Preservation Awards Celebration in 2013. Everyman Theatre will receive an Adaptive Reuse and Compatible Design Award as part of Baltimore Heritage's 2013 historic preservation awards ceremony. Baltimore Heritage is Baltimore's nonprofit historic and architectural preservation organization, which works to preserve and promote Baltimore's historic buildings and neighborhoods.

Baltimore is officially divided into nine geographical regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Central, with each district patrolled by a respective Baltimore Police Department . Interstate 83 and Charles Street down to Hanover Street and Ritchie Highway serve as the east-west dividing line and Eastern Avenue to Route 40 as the north-south dividing line. However, Baltimore Street is north-south dividing line for the U.S. Postal Service . [96] It is not uncommon for locals to divide the city simply by East or West Baltimore, using Charles Street or I-83 as a dividing line or into North and South using Baltimore Street as a dividing line. [ citation needed ] Central Baltimore [ edit ] 

Central Baltimore, originally called the Middle District, [97] stretches north of the Inner Harbor up to the edge of Druid Hill Park . Downtown Baltimore has mainly served as a commercial district with limited residential opportunities. However, between 2000 and 2010, the downtown population grew 130 percent as old commercial properties have been replaced by residential property. [98] Still the city's main commercial area and business district, it includes Baltimore's sports complexes: Oriole Park at Camden Yards , M T Bank Stadium , and the Baltimore Arena ; and the shops and attractions in the Inner Harbor: Harborplace , the Baltimore Convention Center , the National Aquarium , Maryland Science Center , Pier Six Pavilion , and Power Plant Live . [96] 

The University of Maryland, Baltimore , the University of Maryland Medical Center , and Lexington Market are also in the central district, as well as the Hippodrome and many nightclubs, bars, restaurants, shopping centers and various other attractions. [96] [97] The northern portion of Central Baltimore, between downtown and the Druid Hill Park, is home to many of the city's cultural opportunities. Maryland Institute College of Art , the Peabody Institute (music conservatory), George Peabody Library , Enoch Pratt Free Library – Central Library , the Lyric Opera House , the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall , the Walters Art Museum , the Maryland Historical Society and its Enoch Pratt Mansion , and several galleries are located in this region. [99] North Baltimore [ edit ] Sherwood Gardens , Guilford neighborhood, Baltimore 

North Baltimore lies directly north of Central Baltimore and is bounded on the east by The Alameda and on the west by Pimlico Road . Loyola University Maryland , Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus , St. Mary's Seminary and University and Notre Dame of Maryland University are located in this district. Baltimore Polytechnic Institutehigh school for mathematics, science and engineering, and adjacent Western High School , the oldest remaining public girls secondary school in America, share a joint campus at West Cold Spring Lane and Falls Road . [ citation needed ] 

Several historic and notable neighborhoods are in this district: Roland Park (1891), Guilford (1913), Homeland (1924), Hampden , Woodberry , Old Goucher , and Jones Falls . Along the York Road corridor going north are the large neighborhoods of Charles Village , Waverly , and Mount Washington . The Station North Arts and Entertainment District is also located in North Baltimore. [100] South Baltimore [ edit ] Rowhouses, Federal Hill neighborhood, Baltimore 

South Baltimore, a mixed industrial and residential area, consists of the "Old South Baltimore" peninsula below the Inner Harbor and east of the old B O Railroad 's Camden line tracks and Russell Street downtown. It is a culturally, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse waterfront area with neighborhoods such as Locust Point and Riverside around a large park of the same name. [101] Just south of the Inner Harbor, the historic Federal Hill neighborhood, is home to many working professionals, pubs and restaurants. At the end of the peninsula is historic Fort McHenry , a National Park since the end of World War I, when the old U.S. Army Hospital surrounding the 1798 star-shaped battlements was torn down. [102] 

The area south of the Vietnam Veterans (Hanover Street) Bridge and the Patapsco River was annexed to the city in 1919 from being independent towns in Anne Arundel County . [ citation needed ] Across the Hanover Street Bridge are residential areas such as Cherry Hill , [103] Brooklyn , and Curtis Bay , with Fort Armistead bordering the city's south side from Anne Arundel County. [ citation needed ] Northeast Baltimore [ edit ] 

Northeast is primarily a residential neighborhood, home to Morgan State University , bounded by the city line of 1919 on its northern and eastern boundaries, Sinclair Lane , Erdman Avenue , and Pulaski Highway to the south and The Alameda on to the west. Also in this wedge of the city on 33rd Street is Baltimore City College high school, third oldest active public secondary school in the United States, founded downtown in 1839. [104] Across Loch Raven Boulevard is the former site of the old Memorial Stadium for the Baltimore Colts and Baltimore Orioles , now replaced by an YMCA athletic and housing complex. [105] [106] Lake Montebello is in Northeast Baltimore. [97] East Baltimore [ edit ] 

Located below Sinclair Lane and Erdman Avenue , above Orleans Street , East Baltimore is mainly made up of residential neighborhoods. This section of East Baltimore is home to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine on Broadway . Notable neighborhoods include: Armistead Gardens , Broadway East , Barclay , Ellwood Park , Greenmount , and McElderry Park . [97] 

This area was the on-site film location for Homicide: Life on the Street , The Corner and The Wire . [107] Southeast Baltimore [ edit ] 

Southeast Baltimore, located below Fayette Street , bordering the Inner Harbor and the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River to the west, the city line of 1919 on its eastern boundaries and the Patapsco River to the south, is a mixed industrial and residential area. Patterson Park , the "Best Backyard in Baltimore," [108] as well as the Highlandtown Arts District , and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center are located in Southeast Baltimore. The Shops at Canton Crossing opened in 2013. [109] The Canton neighborhood, is located along Baltimore's prime waterfront. Other historic neighborhoods include: Fells Point , Patterson Park , Butchers Hill , Highlandtown , Greektown , Harbor East , Little Italy , and Upper Fells Point . [97] Northwest Baltimore [ edit ] 

Northwestern is bounded by the county line to the north and west, Gwynns Falls Parkway on the south and Pimlico Road on the east, is home to Pimlico Race Course and Sinai Hospital . Its neighborhoods are mostly residential and are dissected by Northern Parkway . The area was the center of Baltimore's Jewish community after World War II. Notable neighborhoods include: Pimlico , Mount Washington , and Cheswolde , and Park Heights . [110] West Baltimore [ edit ] 

West Baltimore is located west of downtown and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and is bounded by Gwynns Falls Parkway, Fremont Avenue , and West Baltimore Street . The Old West Baltimore Historic District includes the neighborhoods of Harlem Park , Sandtown-Winchester , Druid Heights , Madison Park , and Upton . [111] [112] Originally a predominantly German neighborhood, by the last half of the 1800s, Old West Baltimore was home to a substantial section of the city's African American population. It became the largest neighborhood for the city's black community and its cultural, political, and economic center. [111] Coppin State University , Mondawmin Mall , and Edmondson Village are located in this district. The area's crime problems have provided subject material for television series, such as The Wire . [113] Local organizations, such as the Sandtown Habitat for Humanity and the Upton Planning Committee, have been steadily transforming parts of formerly blighted areas of West Baltimore into clean, safe communities. [114] [115] Southwest Baltimore [ edit ] 

Southwest Baltimore is bounded by the Baltimore County line to the west, West Baltimore Street to the north, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Russell Street/Baltimore-Washington Parkway (Maryland Route 295) to the east. Notable neighborhoods in Southwest Baltimore include: Pigtown , Carrolton Ridge , Ridgely's Delight , Leakin Park , Violetville , Lakeland , and Morrell Park . [97] 

St. Agnes Hospital on Wilkens and Caton [97] avenues is located in this district with the neighboring Cardinal Gibbons High School , which is the former site of Babe Ruth 's alma mater, St. Mary's Industrial School. [ citation needed ] Also through this segment of Baltimore ran the beginnings of the historic National Road , which was constructed beginning in 1806 along Old Frederick Road and continuing into the county on Frederick Road into Ellicott City, Maryland . [ citation needed ] Other sides in this district are: Carroll Park , one of the city's largest parks, the colonial Mount Clare Mansion, and Washington Boulevard , which dates to pre-Revolutionary War days as the prime route out of the city to Alexandria, Virginia , and Georgetown on the Potomac River .

Under the Köppen classification , Baltimore lies within the humid subtropical climate zone ( Cfa ), with four distinct seasons, and is part of USDA plant hardiness zones 7b and 8a. [116] Winters are chilly but variable, with sporadic snowfall: January has a daily average of 35.8 °F (2.1 °C), [117] though temperatures reach 50 °F (10 °C) rather often and drop below 20 °F (−7 °C) when Arctic air masses affect the area. [117] 

The average seasonal snowfall is 20.1 inches (51 cm), [118] but it varies greatly depending on the winter, with some seasons seeing minimal snow while others see several major Nor'easters . [a] Due to lessened urban heat island (UHI) as compared to the city proper and distance from the moderating Chesapeake Bay, the outlying and inland parts of the Baltimore metro area are usually cooler, especially at night, than the city proper and the coastal towns. Thus, in the northern and western suburbs, winter snowfall is more significant, and some areas average more than 30 in (76 cm) of snow per winter. [120] It is by no means uncommon for the rain-snow line to set up in the metro area. [121] Freezing rain and sleet occurs a few times each winter in the area, as warm air overrides cold air at the low to mid-levels of the atmosphere. When the wind blows from the east, the cold air gets dammed against the mountains to the west and the result is freezing rain or sleet. 

Spring and autumn are warm, with spring being the wettest season in terms of the number of precipitation days. Summers are hot and humid with a daily average in July of 80.7 °F (27.1 °C), [117] and the combination of heat and humidity leads to rather frequent thunderstorms. A southeasterly bay breeze off the Chesapeake often occurs on summer afternoons when hot air rises over inland areas; prevailing winds from the southwest interacting with this breeze as well as the city proper's UHI can seriously exacerbate air quality. [122] [123] In late summer and early autumn the track of hurricanes or their remnants may cause flooding in downtown Baltimore, despite the city being far removed from the typical coastal storm surge areas. [124] 

Extreme temperatures range from −7 °F (−22 °C) on February 9, 1934, and February 10, 1899 , [b] up to 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 2011. [125] [126] On average, 100 °F (38 °C)+ temperatures occur on 0.9 days annually, 90 °F (32 °C)+ on 37 days, and there are 10 days where the high fails to breach the freezing mark.

At the 2010 Census, there were 620,961 people residing in Baltimore, a decrease of 4.6% since 2000; a substantially more significant decline of 23% happened among school age children (ages 5 to 17). [136] The 2012 Census estimate has the population of Baltimore at 621,342 as of July 2012, an increase of 1,100 residents over the previous year and the first increase in population since its peak in 1950. [137] After decades of decline, downtown Baltimore and its surrounding neighborhoods are seeing a resurgence of young professionals and immigrants, mirroring major cities across the country. The increase, attributed to growing international migration and fewer people abandoning the city, is the second census estimate since Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced at her inauguration in December 2011 that her main goal is to increase the city's population by "10,000 families" within a decade. [136] Gentrification of the surrounding 401 District has grown significantly over the past 10 years in Central and eastern portions of the city. [138] 

According to the 2010 Census , 63.7% of the population was Black , 29.6% White , 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native , 2.3% Asian , 1.8% from some other race and 2.1% of two or more races. 4.2% of Baltimore's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). Non-Hispanic Whites were 28% of the population. [139] 

After New York City , Baltimore was the second city in the United States to reach a population of 100,000. [140] [141] From the 1830 through 1850 U.S. censuses, Baltimore was the second most-populous city, [141] [142] before being surpassed by Philadelphia in 1860. [143] It was among the top 10 cities in population in the United States in every census up to the 1980 census, [144] and after World War II had a population of nearly a million. 

Although Baltimore's population has continued to decline since 1950, the number of families living downtown has increased significantly in recent years, according to the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, Inc. Downtown Baltimore's core area experienced a population increase of 130% since 2000 [ citation needed ] . The area in a one-mile radius of downtown between Pratt and Light streets grew 13.6% during that time as well. New construction and the conversion of obsolete commercial buildings into residences has been a primary factor for growth in the central city. The average household income in downtown increased 39.7% from $45,895 to $64,128. [98] Despite the increase in the number of families, Baltimore's downtown still lost about 10,000 total residents since the 2000 Census, a decline of about 6%. [145] 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Baltimore's population lived in a total of 294,579 housing units in 2009. Age ranges were 22.4% under 18 years old, 11.8% at age 65 or older, and 65.8% from 18 to 64 years old. Baltimore's population was 53.4% female. [146] The median age is 35 years old. 

A statistical abstract prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the median income for a household in the city during 2008 at $30,078, and the median income for a family at $48,216. The same abstract also listed a per capita income of $22,885 for the city in 2008, with 15.4% of families and 19.3% of the population below the poverty line. [147] 

Housing in Baltimore is relatively inexpensive for large, coastal cities of its size. The median sale price for homes in Baltimore in 2012 was $95,000. [148] Despite the housing collapse, and along with the national trends, Baltimore residents still face slowly increasing rent (up 3% in the summer of 2010). [149] Baltimore's racial and ethnic concentrations – Red is non-Hispanic white, Blue is African-American, Green is Asian-American, Orange is Hispanic/Latino, Gray is those of other origins. Each dot represents 25 people. 

The homeless population in Baltimore is steadily increasing; it exceeded 4,000 people in 2011. The increase in the number of young homeless people was particularly severe. [150] The Baltimore—Towson metropolitan area is home to a self-identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at 100,031 individuals, the 18th largest in the United States. [151] In 2012, voters statewide approved the legalization of same-sex marriage in Maryland and authorized them to take place beginning January 1, 2013.

47.33% of the people in Baltimore, Maryland are religious, meaning they affiliate with a religion. 11.85% are Catholic, 0.30% are LDS, and 11.42% are another Christian faith. This includes the next largest affiliation the Baptist Church, which makes up about 7% of the population. The Jewish population of the city is much higher than the average city. About 4.3% of the population is Jewish, compared to the average city, which is only about 0.7% Jewish; 0.10% are an eastern faith; 0.55% affiliates with Islam. [154] [155] Languages [ edit ] 

As of 2010, 90.92% (526,705) of Baltimore residents aged five and older spoke only English at home. In addition, 3.74% (21,661) spoke Spanish , 0.77% (4,442) African languages , 0.70% (4,078) French , and 0.56% (3,237) spoke Chinese . [156] Crime [ edit ] Main article: Crime in Baltimore 

Crime in Baltimore, generally concentrated in areas high in poverty and drug activity, has been above the national average for many years. Baltimore ended 2015, with 344 homicides. [157] continuing a higher per capita homicide rate (52.5 per 100,000 people) than the record set in 1993. [158] [159] 

In 2011, Baltimore police reported 196 homicides, the lowest number of slayings in the city since a count of 197 homicides in 1978 and far lower than the peak homicide count of 353 slayings in 1993. City leaders credit a sustained focus on repeat violent offenders and increased community engagement for the continued drop, reflecting a nationwide decline in crime. [160] [161] 

On August 8, 2014, Baltimore's new youth curfew law went into effect. It prohibits unaccompanied children under age 14 from being on the streets after 9 p.m. and those aged 14–16 from being out after 10 p.m. during the week and 11 p.m. on weekends and during the summer. The goal is to keep children out of dangerous places and reduce crime. [162] 

Crime in Baltimore reached another peak in 2015 when the year's tally of 344 homicides was second only to the record 353 in 1993, when Baltimore had about 100,000 more residents. The killings in 2015 were on pace with recent years in the early months of 2015 but skyrocketed after the unrest and rioting of late April. In five of the next eight months, killings topped 30 or 40 a month. Nearly 90 percent of 2015's homicides were the result of shootings, renewing calls for new gun laws. Counting nonfatal shootings, gun violence was up more than 75 percent compared to 2014, with more than 900 people shot. [ citation needed ] Economy [ edit ] 

Once a predominantly industrial town, with an economic base focused on steel processing, shipping, auto manufacturing (General Motors Baltimore Assembly ), and transportation, the city experienced deindustrialization which cost residents tens of thousands of low-skill, high-wage jobs. [163] The city now relies on a low-wage service economy , which accounts for 90% of jobs in the city. [164] [165] Around the turn of the century, Baltimore was the leading US manufacturer of rye whiskey and straw hats . It also led in refining of crude oil, brought to the city by pipeline from Pennsylvania. [166] 

As of March 2015 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates Baltimore's unemployment rate at 8.1% [167] while one quarter of Baltimore residents (and 37% of Baltimore children) live in poverty. [168] The 2012 closure of a major steel plant at Sparrows Point is expected to have a further impact on employment and the local economy. [169] The Census Bureau reported in 2013 that 207,000 workers commute into Baltimore city each day. [170] Downtown Baltimore is the primary economic asset within Baltimore City and the region with 29.1 million square feet of office space. The tech sector is rapidly growing as the Baltimore metro ranks 8th in the CBRE Tech Talent Report among 50 U.S. metro areas for high growth rate and number of tech professionals. [171] Forbes ranked Baltimore fourth among America's "new tech hot spots". [172] 

The city is home to the Johns Hopkins Hospital . Other large companies in Baltimore include Under Armour , [173] Cordish Company , [174] Legg Mason , McCormick Company , T. Rowe Price , and Royal Farms . [175] A sugar refinery owned by American Sugar Refining is one of Baltimore's cultural icons. Nonprofits based in Baltimore include Lutheran Services in America and Catholic Relief Services . 

Almost a quarter of the jobs in the Baltimore region were in science, technology, engineering and math as of mid 2013, in part attributed to the city's extensive undergraduate and graduate schools; maintenance and repair experts were included in this count. [176] Port [ edit ] 

The center of international commerce for the region is the World Trade Center Baltimore . It houses the Maryland Port Administration and U.S. headquarters for major shipping lines. Baltimore is ranked 9th for total dollar value of cargo and 13th for cargo tonnage for all U.S. ports. In 2014, total cargo moving through the port totaled 29.5 million tons, down from 30.3 million tons in 2013. The value of cargo traveling through the port in 2014 came to $52.5 billion, down from $52.6 billion in 2013. The Port of Baltimore generates $3 billion in annual wages and salary, as well as supporting 14,630 direct jobs and 108,000 jobs connected to port work. In 2014, the port also generated more than $300 million in taxes. It serves over 50 ocean carriers making nearly 1,800 annual visits. Among all U.S. ports, Baltimore is first in handling automobiles, light trucks, farm and construction machinery; and imported forest products, aluminum, and sugar. The port is second in coal exports. The Port of Baltimore's cruise industry, which offers year-round trips on several lines supports over 500 jobs and brings in over $90 million to Maryland's economy annually. Growth at the port continues with the Maryland Port Administration plans to turn the southern tip of the former steel mill into a marine terminal, primarily for car and truck shipments, but also for anticipated new business coming to Baltimore after the completion of the Panama Canal expansion project . [177] Tourism [ edit ] 

Baltimore's history and attractions have allowed the city to become a strong tourist destination on the East Coast. In 2014, the city hosted 24.5 million visitors, who spent $5.2 billion. [178] The Baltimore Visitor Center, which is operated by Visit Baltimore , is located on Light Street in the Inner Harbor . Much of the city's tourism centers around the Inner Harbor, with the National Aquarium being Maryland's top tourist destination. Baltimore Harbor's restoration has made it "a city of boats", with several historic ships and other attractions on display and open for the public to visit. The USS Constellation , the last Civil War-era vessel afloat, is docked at the head of the Inner Harbor; the USS Torsk , a submarine that holds the Navy's record for dives (more than 10,000); and the Coast Guard cutter Taney , the last surviving U.S. warship that was in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, and which engaged Japanese Zero aircraft during the battle. [179] 

Also docked is the lightship Chesapeake , which for decades marked the entrance to Chesapeake Bay; and the Seven Foot Knoll Lighthouse, the oldest surviving screw-pile lighthouse on Chesapeake Bay, which once marked the mouth of the Patapsco River and the entrance to Baltimore. All of these attractions are owned and maintained by the Historic Ships in Baltimore organization. The Inner Harbor also is the home port of Pride of Baltimore II , the state of Maryland's "goodwill ambassador" ship, a reconstruction of a famous Baltimore Clipper ship. [179] 

Other popular tourist destinations throughout the city include Oriole Park at Camden Yards , Fort McHenry , the Mount Vernon and Fells Point neighborhoods, and museums such as the Walters Art Museum , the Baltimore Museum of Industry , and the B O Railroad Museum .

Historically a working-class port town, Baltimore has sometimes been dubbed a "city of neighborhoods", with 72 designated historic districts [180] traditionally occupied by distinct ethnic groups. Most notable today are three downtown areas along the port: the Inner Harbor, frequented by tourists due to its hotels, shops, and museums; Fells Point, once a favorite entertainment spot for sailors but now refurbished and gentrified (and featured in the movie Sleepless in Seattle ); and Little Italy , located between the other two, where Baltimore's Italian-American community is based – and where former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi grew up. Further inland, Mount Vernon is the traditional center of cultural and artistic life of the city; it is home to a distinctive Washington Monument , set atop a hill in a 19th-century urban square, that predates the more well-known monument in Washington, D.C. by several decades. Baltimore also has a significant German American population, [181] and was the second largest port of immigration to the United States, behind Ellis Island in New York and New Jersey. Between 1820 and 1989, almost 2 million who were German, Polish , English, Irish, Russian , Lithuanian , French , Ukrainian , Czech , Greek and Italian came to Baltimore, most between the years 1861 to 1930. By 1913, when Baltimore was averaging forty thousand immigrants per year, World War I closed off the flow of immigrants. By 1970, Baltimore's heyday as an immigration center was a distant memory. There also was a Chinatown dating back to at least the 1880s which consisted of no more than 400 Chinese residents. A local Chinese-American association remains based there, but only one Chinese restaurant as of 2009. Emerson Bromo-Seltzer Tower , built in 1911. The 15 stories of the Bromo Seltzer Tower have been transformed into studio spaces for visual and literary artists 

Baltimore has quite a history when it comes to making beer, an art that thrived in Baltimore from the 1800s to the 1950s with over 100 old breweries in the city's past. [182] The best remaining example of that history is the old American Brewery Building on North Gay Street and the National Brewing Company building in the Brewer's Hill neighborhood. In the 1940s the National Brewing Company introduced the nation's first six-pack. National's two most prominent brands, were National Bohemian Beer colloquially "Natty Boh" and Colt 45 . Listed on the Pabst website as a "Fun Fact", Colt 45 was named after running back #45 Jerry Hill of the 1963 Baltimore Colts and not the .45 caliber handgun ammunition round . Both brands are still made today and served all around the Baltimore area at bars, Oriole and Ravens games. The Natty Boh logo appears on all cans, bottles, and packaging; and merchandise featuring him can still easily be found in shops in Maryland, including several in Fells Point . 

Each year the Artscape takes place in the city in the Bolton Hill neighborhood, due to its proximity to Maryland Institute College of Art. Artscape styles itself as the "largest free arts festival in America". [183] Each May, the Maryland Film Festival takes place in Baltimore, using all five screens of the historic Charles Theatre as its anchor venue. Many movies and television shows have been filmed in Baltimore. The Wire was set and filmed in Baltimore. House of Cards is set in Washington, D.C. but filmed in Baltimore. [184] 

Baltimore has cultural museums in many areas of study. The Baltimore Museum of Art , and the Walters Art Museum are internationally renowned for its collection of art. The Baltimore Museum of Art has the largest holding of works by Henri Matisse in the world. [185] The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum is the first African American wax museum in the country, featuring more than 150 life-size and lifelike wax figures. [40] Cuisine [ edit ] 

Baltimore is known for its Maryland blue crabs , crab cake, Old Bay Seasoning , pit beef, and the "chicken box." The city has many restaurants in or around the Inner Harbor. The Little Italy neighborhood's biggest draw is the food. Fells Point also is a foodie neighborhood for tourists and locals and is where the oldest continuously running tavern in the country, "The Horse You Came In On Saloon," is located. [186] Many of the city's upscale restaurants can be found in Harbor East . Five public markets are located across the city. The Baltimore Public Market System is the oldest continuously operating public market system in the United States. [187] Lexington Market is one of the longest-running markets in the world and longest running in the country, having been around since 1782. The market continues to stand at its original site. Baltimore is the last place in America where one can still find arabbers , vendors who sell fresh fruits and vegetables from a horse-drawn cart that goes up and down neighborhood streets. [188] Food- and drink-rating site Zagat ranked Baltimore second in a list of the 17 best food cities in the country in 2015. [189] Local dialect [ edit ] Main article: Baltimore dialect 

One thing visitors quickly notice is that some locals refer to their city as "Balmer", dropping the "t". The traditional local accent, particular to some working-class areas of the city, has long been noted and celebrated as "Baltimorese" or "Bawlmorese". While in other parts of the city, locals refer to their city as "Baldamore". Baltimore's dialect is a member of the Atlantic midland English dialect group, and shares many characteristics with Philadelphia 's, such as the addition of an "eh" sound before a long "o". Its influence distinguishes Baltimore, especially with words containing "oi" flattened into an "aw" sound. [190] The Baltimore accent, however is noted for sounding more southern than Philadelphia's. Glide deletion in the accent is present, with the long "i" sound being flattened to "ah" among certain speakers before voiced, liquid and nasal consonants. Due to its combination of rhoticity and glide deletion, the word "iron" is pronounced somewhat like "arn" and the word "fire" like "far". [ citation needed ] 

Baltimore native John Waters parodies the city and its dialect extensively in his films. Most of them are filmed and/or set in Baltimore, including the 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos , as well as Hairspray and its Broadway musical remake .

Prior to an NFL team moving to Baltimore, there had been several attempts at a professional football team prior to the 1950s. Most were minor league or semi-professional teams. The first major league to base a team in Baltimore was the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which had a team named the Baltimore Colts . The AAFC Colts played for three seasons in the AAFC (1947, 1948, and 1949), and when the AAFC folded following the 1949 season, moved to the NFL for a single year (1950) before going bankrupt. Three years later, the NFL's Dallas Texans would itself fold, and its assets and player contracts purchased by an ownership team headed by Baltimore businessman Carroll Rosenbloom , who moved the team to Baltimore, establishing a new team also named the Baltimore Colts . During the 1950s and 1960s, the Colts were one of the NFLs more successful franchises, led by NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas who set a then-record of 47 consecutive games with a touchdown pass. The Colts advanced to the NFL Championship twice (1958 1959) and Super Bowl twice (1969 1971), winning all except Super Bowl III in 1969. After the 1983 season, the team left Baltimore for Indianapolis in 1984 , where it became the Indianapolis Colts . 

The NFL returned to Baltimore when the former Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens in 1996. Since then, the Ravens won a Super Bowl championship in 2000 and 2012 , four AFC North division championships (2003, 2006, 2011 and 2012), and appeared in four AFC Championship Games (2000, 2008, 2011 and 2012).

Baltimore has a long and storied baseball history, including its distinction as the birthplace of Babe Ruth in 1895. The original 19th century Baltimore Orioles were one of the most successful early franchises, featuring numerous hall of famers during its years from 1882 to 1899. As one of the eight inaugural American League franchises, the Baltimore Orioles played in the AL during the 1901 and 1902 seasons. The team moved to New York City before the 1903 season and was renamed the New York Highlanders, which later became the New York Yankees. Ruth played for the minor league Baltimore Orioles team, which was active from 1903 to 1914. After playing one season in 1915 as the Richmond Climbers, the team returned the following year to Baltimore, where it played as the Orioles until 1953. [197] 

The team currently known as the Baltimore Orioles has represented Major League Baseball locally since 1954 when the St. Louis Browns moved to the city of Baltimore. The Orioles advanced to the World Series in 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979 and 1983, winning three times (1966, 1970 and 1983), while making the playoffs all but one year (1972) from 1969 through 1974.

As of 2015 [update] , The Trust for Public Land , a national land conservation organization, ranks Baltimore 40th among the 75 largest U.S. cities. [200] Government [ edit ] 

Baltimore is an independent city , and not part of any county . For most governmental purposes under Maryland law, Baltimore City is treated as a county-level entity. The United States Census Bureau uses counties as the basic unit for presentation of statistical information in the United States, and treats Baltimore as a county equivalent for those purposes. 

Baltimore has been a Democratic stronghold for over 150 years, with Democrats dominating every level of government. In virtually all elections, the Democratic primary is the real contest. [202] The city hosted the first six Democratic National Conventions , from 1832 through 1852, and hosted the DNC again in 1860 , 1872 , and 1912 . [203] [204] City government [ edit ] Mayor [ edit ] For a full list of mayors, see List of Baltimore Mayors . 

Sheila Dixon became the first female mayor of Baltimore on January 17, 2007. As the former City Council President, she assumed the office of Mayor when former Mayor Martin O'Malley took office as Governor of Maryland. [205] On November 6, 2007, Dixon won the Baltimore mayoral election . Mayor Dixon's administration ended less than three years after her election, the result of a criminal investigation that began in 2006 while she was still City Council President. She was convicted on a single misdemeanor charge of embezzlement on December 1, 2009. A month later, Dixon made an Alford plea to a perjury charge and agreed to resign from office; Maryland, like most states, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. [206] [207] 

Stephanie Rawlings-Blake , who was City Council President at that time, assumed the office of Mayor on February 4, 2010, when Dixon's resignation became effective. [208] She was elected to a full term in 2011, receiving 84% of the vote. [209] Baltimore City Hall Baltimore City Council [ edit ] 

Grassroots pressure for reform, voiced as Question P , restructured the city council in November 2002, against the will of the mayor, the council president, and the majority of the council. A coalition of union and community groups, organized by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), backed the effort. [210] 

The Baltimore City Council is now made up of 14 single-member districts and one elected at-large council president. Bernard C. "Jack" Young has been the council president since February 2010, when he was unanimously elected by the other council members to replace Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who had become mayor. [211] Edward Reisinger, the 10th district representative, is the council's current vice president. [212] Law enforcement [ edit ] 

The Baltimore City Police Department , founded 1784 as a "Night City Watch" and day Constables system and later reorganized as a City Department in 1853, with a following reorganization under State of Maryland supervision in 1859, with appointments made by the Governor of Maryland after a disturbing period of civic and elections violence with riots in the later part of the decade, is the current primary law enforcement agency serving the citizens of the City of Baltimore. Campus and building security for the city's public schools is provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools Police, established in the 1970s.

Baltimore City Fire Department [ edit ] Main article: Baltimore City Fire Department 

The city of Baltimore is protected by the over 1,800 professional firefighters of the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD), which was founded in December 1858 and began operating the following year. Replacing several warring independent volunteer companies since the 1770s and the confusion resulting from a riot involving the " Know-Nothing " political party two years before, the establishment of a unified professional fire fighting force was a major advance in urban governance. The BCFD operates out of 37 fire stations located throughout the city and has a long history and sets of traditions in its various houses and divisions.

Three of the state's eight congressional districts include portions of Baltimore: the 2nd , represented by Dutch Ruppersberger ; the 3rd , represented by John Sarbanes ; and the 7th , represented by Elijah Cummings . All three are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Baltimore in Congress since John Boynton Philip Clayton Hill represented the 3rd District in 1927, and has not represented any of Baltimore since the Eastern Shore -based 1st District lost its share of Baltimore after the 2000 census; it was represented by Republican Wayne Gilchrest at the time. 

Both of Maryland's senators , Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski , are from Baltimore. The last three people to represent Maryland in the Senate represented the 3rd District before being elected to the Senate. Paul Sarbanes represented the 3rd from 1971 until 1977, when he was elected to the first of five terms in the Senate. Sarbanes was succeeded by Mikulski, who represented the 3rd from 1977 to 1987.

The Interstate highways serving Baltimore are I-70 , I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95 (the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway north of the city), I-395 , I-695 (the Baltimore Beltway), I-795 (the Northwest Expressway), I-895 (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and I-97 . The city's mainline Interstate highways—I-95, I-83, and I-70—do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of freeway revolts in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by Barbara Mikulski, now a United States senator , which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore Fort McHenry Tunnel (serving I-95 ) and the two-bore Harbor Tunnel (serving I-895). The Baltimore Beltway crosses south of Baltimore Harbor over the Francis Scott Key Bridge . 

The only U.S. Highways in the city are US 1 , which bypasses downtown, and US 40 , which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for Interstate 170 . State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of Maryland Route 295 , which carries the Baltimore–Washington Parkway . 

The Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems. [228] In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and traffic cameras . [229] [230] BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore. These include all streets that are marked as state and U.S. highways as well as the portions of I-83 and I-70 within the city limits. The only highways within the city that are not maintained by BCDOT are I-95, I-395, I-695, and I-895; those four highways are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority. [231] Transit systems [ edit ] Public transit [ edit ] Charm City Circulator Van Hool A330 #1101 on the Orange Line 

Public transit in Baltimore is mostly provided by the Maryland Transit Administration (abbreviated "MTA Maryland") and Charm City Circulator . MTA Maryland operates a comprehensive bus network, including many local, express, and commuter buses, a light rail network connecting Hunt Valley in the north to BWI Airport and Cromwell ( Glen Burnie ) in the south, and a subway line between Owings Mills and Johns Hopkins Hospital. [232] A proposed rail line, known as the Red Line , which would link the Social Security Administration to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and perhaps the Canton and Dundalk communities, was cancelled as of June 2015 by Governor Larry Hogan ; a proposal to extend Baltimore's existing subway line to Morgan State University, known as the Green Line , is in the planning stages. [233] 

The Charm City Circulator (CCC), a shuttle bus service operated by Veolia Transportation for the Baltimore Department of Transportation, began operating in the downtown area in January 2010. Funded partly by a 16 percent increase in the city's parking fees, the circulator provides free bus service seven days a week, picking up passengers every 15 minutes at designated stops during service hours. [234] [235] 

The CCC's first bus line, the Orange route, travels between Hollins Market and Harbor East. Its Purple route, launched June 7, 2010, operates between Penn Station and Federal Hill. The Green route runs between Johns Hopkins and City Hall. [235] [236] The Charm City Circulator operates a fleet of diesel and hybrid vehicles built by DesignLine, Orion, and Van Hool. [234] Intercity rail [ edit ] Baltimore Pennsylvania Station 

Baltimore is a top destination for Amtrak along the Northeast Corridor . Baltimore's Penn Station is one of the busiest in the country. In FY 2014, Penn Station was ranked the seventh-busiest rail station in the United States by number of passengers served each year. [237] The building sits on a raised "island" of sorts between two open trenches, one for the Jones Falls Expressway and the other for the tracks of the Northeast Corridor (NEC). The NEC approaches from the south through the two-track, 7,660-foot Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel , which opened in 1873 and whose 30 mph limit, sharp curves, and steep grades make it one of the NEC's worst bottlenecks. The NEC's northern approach is the 1873 Union Tunnel , which has one single-track bore and one double-track bore. 

Just outside the city, Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport Rail Station is another popular stop. Amtrak's Acela Express , Palmetto , Carolinian , Silver Star , Silver Meteor , Vermonter , Crescent , and Northeast Regional trains are the scheduled passenger train services that stop in the city. Additionally, MARC commuter rail service connects the city's two main intercity rail stations, Camden Station and Penn Station, with Washington, D.C.'s Union Station as well as stops in between. The MARC consists of 3 lines; the Brunswick, Camden and Penn. On December 7, 2013 the Penn Line began weekend service. [238] Airports [ edit ] The interior of Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport , Baltimore's major commercial airport 

Baltimore is served by two airports, both operated by the Maryland Aviation Administration, which is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation . [239] Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport , generally known as "BWI," lies about 10 miles (16 km) to the south of Baltimore in neighboring Anne Arundel County . The airport is named after Thurgood Marshall , a Baltimore native who was the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States . In terms of passenger traffic, BWI is the 24th busiest airport in the United States. [240] As of calendar year 2014, BWI is the largest, by passenger count, of three major airports serving the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area . It is accessible by I-95 and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway via Interstate 195 , the Baltimore Light Rail , and Amtrak and MARC Train at BWI Rail Station . 

Baltimore is also served by Martin State Airport , a general aviation facility, to the northeast in Baltimore County. Martin State Airport is linked to downtown Baltimore by Maryland Route 150 (Eastern Avenue) and by MARC Train at its own station . Pedestrians and bicycles [ edit ] 

Baltimore has a comprehensive system of bicycle routes in the city. These routes are not numbered, but are typically denoted with green signs sporting a silhouette of a bicycle upon an outline of the city's border, and denote the distance to destinations, much like bicycle routes in the rest of the state. The roads carrying bicycle routes are also labelled with either bike lanes, sharrows, or Share the Road signs. Many of these routes pass through the downtown area. The network of bicycle lanes in the city continues to expand, with over 140 miles added between 2006 and 2014. [241] Alongside bike lanes, Baltimore has also built bike boulevards , starting with Guilford Avenue in 2012. 

Baltimore currently has three major trail systems within the city. The Gwynns Falls Trail runs from the Inner Harbor to the I-70 Park and Ride, passing through Gwynns Falls Park and possessing numerous branches. There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The Jones Falls Trail currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long term plans call for it to extend to the Mount Washington Light Rail Stop , and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the East Coast Greenway through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from Harford Road east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively. 

In addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Baltimore the 14th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. [242] Port of Baltimore [ edit ] Main article: Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore Eastward view Baltimore's Inner Harbor Baltimore harbor in 1849 with the prominent Washington Monument in the background north of the city Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Baltimore harbor. 

The port was founded in 1706, preceding the founding of Baltimore. The Maryland colonial legislature made the area near Locust Point as the port of entry for the tobacco trade with England. Fells Point, the deepest point in the natural harbor, soon became the colony's main ship building center, later on becoming leader in the construction of clipper ships . [243] 

After Baltimore's founding, mills were built behind the wharves. The California Gold Rush led to many orders for fast vessels; many overland pioneers also relied upon canned goods from Baltimore. After the Civil War, a coffee ship was designed here for trade with Brazil . At the end of the nineteenth century, European ship lines had terminals for immigrants. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad made the port a major transshipment point. [244] :17,75 Currently the port has major roll-on/roll-off facilities, as well as bulk facilities, especially steel handling. [245] 

Water taxis also operate in the Inner Harbor. Governor Ehrlich participated in naming the port after Helen Delich Bentley during the 300th anniversary of the port. [246] 

In 2007, Duke Realty Corporation began a new development near the Port of Baltimore, named the Chesapeake Commerce Center. This new industrial park is located on the site of a former General Motors plant. The total project comprises 184 acres (0.74 km 2 ) in eastern Baltimore City, and the site will yield 2,800,000 square feet (260,000 m 2 ) of warehouse/distribution and office space. Chesapeake Commerce Center has direct access to two major Interstate highways ( I-95 and I-895 ) and is located adjacent to two of the major Port of Baltimore terminals. The Port of Baltimore is one of two seaports on the U.S. East Coast with a 50-foot (15 m) dredge to accommodate the largest shipping vessels. [247] 

Along with cargo terminals, the port also has a passenger cruise terminal, which offers year-round trips on several lines, including Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas and Carnival's Pride. Overall five cruise lines have operated out of the port to the Bahamas and the Caribbean, while some ships traveled to New England and Canada. The terminal has become a popular embarkation point where passengers have the rare opportunity to park and board next to the ship visible from Interstate 95. [248] Passengers from Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey make up a third of the volume, with travelers from Maryland, Virginia, the District and even Ohio and the Carolinas making up the rest. [249] Environment [ edit ] Water Pollution Control [ edit ] 

Baltimore's Inner Harbor, known for its skyline waterscape and its tourist friendly-areas, was horribly polluted. The waterway was often filled with garbage after heavy rainstorms, failing its 2014 water quality report card. The Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore took steps to remediate the waterways, in hopes that the harbor would be fishable and swimmable once again. Installed in May 2014, the Water Wheel, known as Mr. Trash Wheel, sits at the mouth of the Jones Falls River in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. A February 2015 agreement with a local waste-to-energy plant, is believed to make Baltimore the first city to use reclaimed waterway debris to generate electricity. [250] 

Mr. Trash Wheel is the world's first permanent water wheel trash interceptor to clean up the city's polluted Inner Harbor. [251] The Jones Falls river watershed drains fifty-eight square miles of land outside of Baltimore and is a significant source of trash that enters the harbor. Garbage collected by Mr. Trash Wheel could come from anywhere in the Jones Falls Watershed area. [252] The wheel moves continuously, removing garbage and dumping it into an attached dumpster using only hydro and solar renewable power to keep its wheel turning. It has the capability to collect 50,000 pounds of trash per day, and has removed more than 350 tons of litter from Baltimore's landmark and tourist attraction in its first 18 months, estimated as consisting of approximately 200,000 bottles, 173,000 potato chip bags and 6.7 million cigarettes butts. [253] [254] The Water Wheel has been very successful at trash removal, visibly decreasing the amount of garbage that collects in the harbor, especially after a rainfall. 

The Waterfront Partnership is raising money to build a second Water Wheel at the end of Harris Creek, an entirely piped stream that flows beneath Baltimore's Canton neighborhood and empties into the Baltimore Harbor. Harris Creek is known to carry tons of trash every year. [255] [256] The planned new Water Wheel will capture that trash and keep it out of the Harbor, Chesapeake Bay, and Atlantic Ocean. A number of projects are going on in Baltimore City and County that should result in better water quality scores. These projects include the Blue Alleys project, the Water Wheel, expanded street sweeping, and stream restoration. [251] 

In August 2010, the National Aquarium assembled, planted, and launched a floating wetland island designed by Biohabitats in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. [257] Hundreds of years ago Baltimore's harbor shoreline would have been lined with tidal wetlands . Floating wetlands provide many environmental benefits to water quality and habitat enhancement, which is why the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore has included them in their Healthy Harbor Initiative pilot projects. [258] Biohabitats also developed a concept to transform a dilapidated wharf into a living pier that cleans Harbor water, provides habitat and is an aesthetic attraction. Currently under design, the top of the pier will become a constructed tidal wetland . [259] The city also has a fleet of trash skimmer operators to clean the harbor, which together accumulate a total of 200,000 tons of trash each year. [260] Media [ edit ] Main article: Media in Baltimore 

Baltimore's main newspaper is The Baltimore Sun . It was sold by its Baltimore owners in 1986 to the Times Mirror Company, [261] which was bought by the Tribune Company in 2000. [262] The Baltimore News-American , another long-running paper that competed with the Sun, ceased publication in 1986. [263] 

The city is home to the Baltimore Afro-American , an influential African American newspaper founded in 1892. [264] [265] 

In 2006, The Baltimore Examiner was launched to compete with The Sun . It was part of a national chain that includes The San Francisco Examiner and The Washington Examiner . In contrast to the paid subscription Sun , The Examiner was a free newspaper funded solely by advertisements. Unable to turn a profit and facing a deep recession, The Baltimore Examiner ceased publication on February 15, 2009. 

Despite being located 40 miles northeast of Washington, D.C. , Baltimore is a major media market in its own right, with all major English language television networks represented in the city. WJZ-TV is a CBS owned and operated station , and WBFF is the flagship of Sinclair Broadcast Group , the largest station owner in the country. 

Nielsen ranked Baltimore as the 26th-largest television market for the 2008–2009 viewing season and the 27th-largest for 2009–2010. [266] Arbitron's Fall 2010 rankings identified Baltimore as the 22nd largest radio market. [267] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from Baltimore Sister cities [ edit ] 

Baltimore has ten sister cities , as designated by Sister Cities International : [268] [269] Ashkelon , Israel (2005) Bremerhaven , Germany (2007) Gbarnga , Liberia (1973) Genoa , Italy (1985) Kawasaki , Kanagawa , Japan (1978) Luxor , Egypt (1982) Odessa , Ukraine (1974) Piraeus , Greece (1982) Rotterdam , Netherlands (1985) Xiamen , China (1985) See also [ edit ] Baltimore portal Maryland portal North America portal United States portal Geography portal Baltimore Development Corporation Baltimore in fiction Bluegrass in Baltimore: The Hard Drivin' Sound and its Legacy (Book on the history of the Appalachian migrants move into the city in the 20th Century) Cemeteries in Baltimore, Maryland History of the Germans in Baltimore, Maryland Moveable Feast Notes [ edit ] ^ Officially, seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from 0.7 in (1.8 cm) in 1949–50 to 77.0 in (196 cm) in 2009–10. See North American blizzard of 2009#Snowfall (December 19–20, 2009), First North American blizzard of 2010#Snowfall (February 5–6, 2010), and Second North American blizzard of 2010#Impact (February 9–10, 2010). The February storms contributed to a monthly accumulation of 50.0 in (127 cm), the most for any month. [118] If no snow fell outside of February that winter, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th snowiest. [119] ^ Since 1950, when the National Weather Service switched to using the suburban and generally much cooler BWI Airport as the official Baltimore climatology station, this extreme has repeated three times: January 29, 1963, January 17, 1982 , and January 22, 1984. ^ Temperature, precipitation normals are recorded at Maryland Science Center in downtown; the National Weather Service does not yet record snowfall at this location, so the snow normals for BWI Airport , at an elevation of 156 ft (47.5 m) about 10 mi (16 km) south of downtown, are shown. Likewise humidity and sun duration normals were recorded at BWI Airport. References [ edit ] ^ a b c Donovan, Doug (May 20, 2006).

"Census shows striking growth in Baltimore homelessness Population swells nearly 20 percent in two years; ranks of homeless young people increase 50 percent" . CityPaper . Retrieved August 9, 2012 . The biennial homeless censuses, which are required under federal law and are conducted on a single day—this year, Jan. 25—have trended upward since the first one in 2003 counted 2,681 homeless people in Baltimore, compared to 4,088 this year, according to the report by Morgan State's School of Architecture and Planning. Called a "point-in-time" survey, the census effort looks for homeless people living on the streets as well as those checking into shelters and hospital emergency rooms and receiving other homeless services. The count of Baltimore's young homeless people, which is evaluated separately by the Center for Adolescent Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and is undertaken over a period of weeks instead of one day, has risen 135 percent since 2007, from 272 to 640. Rather than canvassing the streets for homeless youngsters, the effort relies on data provided by cooperating service providers, including the city public-schools system. ^ Gary J. Gates, PhD.

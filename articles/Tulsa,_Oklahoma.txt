Tulsa / ˈ t ʌ l s ə / is the second-largest city in the state of Oklahoma and 47th-most populous city in the United States. As of July 2015, the population was 403,505, an increase of 11,599 over that reported in the 2010 Census . [5] It is the principal municipality of the Tulsa Metropolitan Area , a region with 981,005 residents in the MSA and 1,151,172 in the CSA . [6] The city serves as the county seat of Tulsa County , the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, [7] with urban development extending into Osage , Rogers , and Wagoner counties. [5] 

Tulsa was settled between 1828 and 1836 by the Lochapoka Band of Creek Native American tribe. For most of the 20th century, the city held the nickname " Oil Capital of the World " and played a major role as one of the most important hubs for the American oil industry . [8] 

Once heavily dependent on the oil industry, economic downturn and subsequent diversification efforts created an economic base in the energy, finance, aviation, telecommunications and technology sectors. [9] The Tulsa Port of Catoosa , at the head of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System , is the most inland river port in the U.S. with access to international waterways. [10] [11] Two institutions of higher education within the city have sports teams at the NCAA Division I level, Oral Roberts University and the University of Tulsa . 

It is situated on the Arkansas River at the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in northeast Oklahoma, a region of the state known as " Green Country ". Considered the cultural and arts center of Oklahoma, [12] [13] Tulsa houses two world-renowned art museums, full-time professional opera and ballet companies, and one of the nation's largest concentrations of art deco architecture. [14] The city has been called one of America's most livable large cities by Partners for Livable Communities, [15] Forbes , [16] and Relocate America. [17] FDi Magazine in 2009 ranked the city no. 8 in the U.S. for cities of the future. [18] In 2012, Tulsa was ranked among the top 50 best cities in the United States by BusinessWeek . [19] People from Tulsa are called "Tulsans".

The area where Tulsa now exists was considered Indian Territory when it was first formally settled by the Lochapoka / Creek tribes in 1836. [20] They established a small settlement under the Creek Council Oak Tree at the present day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. This area and this tree reminded Chief Tukabahchi and his small group of trail of tear survivors of the bend in the river and their previous Creek Council Oak Tree back in the Talisi, Alabama area. They named their new settlement Tallasi , meaning "old town" in the Creek language, which later became "Tulsa". [20] The area around Tulsa was also settled by members of the other so-called " Five Civilized Tribes " who had relocated to Oklahoma from the Southern United States; most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the Cherokee Nation and Osage Nation . 

Although Oklahoma was not yet a state during the Civil War , the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah took place on the north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction treaties with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch , the Dalton Gang , and Little Britches . Incorporation and "Oil Capital" prosperity [ edit ] 

On January 18, 1898, Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected its first mayor, Edward Calkins. [21] 

Tulsa was a small town near the banks of the Arkansas River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1, [21] was established. Much of the oil was discovered on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the Osage Nation under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the large Glenn Pool (located approximately 15 miles south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of Glenpool ) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930. [22] By 1909, seven years after the discovery of oil in the area, Tulsa's population had sprouted to 180,000. Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the South and Texas, many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest. This migration distinguished the city's demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa's upscale neighborhoods. 

Known as the "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century, the city's success in the energy industry prompted construction booms in the popular Art Deco style of the time. [8] Profits from the oil industry continued through the Great Depression , helping the city's economy fare better than most in the United States during the 1930s. [23] Cain's Ballroom came to be known as the "Carnegie Hall of Western Swing" [24] in the early 20th century. 

In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to the " Black Wall Street ", one of the most prosperous black communities in the United States at the time. [25] Located in the Greenwood neighborhood, it was the site of the Tulsa Race Riot , one of the nation's worst acts of racial violence and civil disorder, with whites attacking blacks. [25] Sixteen hours of rioting on May 31 and June 1, 1921, was only ended when National Guardsmen were brought in by the Governor. An official report later claimed that 23 black and 16 white citizens were killed, but other estimates suggest as many as 300 people died, most of them black. [25] Over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, and an estimated 10,000 people were left homeless as 35 city blocks, composed of 1,256 residences, were destroyed by fire. Property damage was estimated at $1.8 million . [25] Efforts to obtain reparations for survivors of the violence have been unsuccessful but the city and state re-examined the events in the early 21st century, acknowledging the terrible actions that had taken place. [26] A 1909 panoramic view of Tulsa 

In 1925, Tulsa businessman Cyrus Avery , known as the "Father of Route 66 ," [27] began his campaign to create a road linking Chicago to Los Angeles by establishing the U.S. Highway 66 Association in Tulsa, earning the city the nickname the "Birthplace of Route 66". [28] Once completed, U.S. Route 66 took an important role in Tulsa's development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the Blue Whale of Catoosa . During this period, Bob Wills and his group, The Texas Playboys , began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, Cain's Ballroom became the base for the group, [24] which is largely credited for creating Western Swing music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today. [24] 

For the remainder of the mid-20th century, the city had a master plan to construct parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising. [8] The Spavinaw Dam , built during this era to accommodate the city's water needs, was considered one of the largest public works projects of the era. [29] In the 1950s, Time magazine dubbed Tulsa as "America's Most Beautiful City." [8] 

A national recession greatly affected the city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily dependent on oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. [30] Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, was one of the hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. [30] By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, [30] but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy. Tulsa in the twenty-first century [ edit ] 

In 2003, the " Vision 2025 " program was approved by voters, to enhance and revitalize Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of the initiative, the BOK Center , was designed to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect Cesar Pelli , broke ground in 2005 [31] and was opened on August 30, 2008. [32] Geography [ edit ] The Tulsa skyline as viewed from Turkey Mountain As seen from space, most of Tulsa lies east of the Arkansas River. 

Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma, 99 miles (159 km) northeast of Oklahoma City ; situated between the edge of the Great Plains and the foot of the Ozarks in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the Cross Timbers , an ecoregion of forest and prairie transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east. [33] With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to " Green Country ", a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region's green vegetation and relatively large number of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma, [34] which lie largely in the drier Great Plains region of the Central United States. Located near the western edge of the U.S. Interior Highlands , northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing seven of Oklahoma's 11 eco-regions [35] and more than half of its state parks. [36] The region encompasses 30 lakes or reservoirs [37] and borders the neighboring states of Kansas , Missouri , and Arkansas . The geographic coordinates of the city of Tulsa are 36°7′53″N 95°56′14″W ﻿ / ﻿ 36.13139°N 95.93722°W ﻿ / 36.13139; -95.93722 (36.131294, −95.937332), [38] with an elevation of 700 feet (210 m) above sea level. Topography [ edit ] 

The city developed on both sides of the prominent Arkansas River, which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood control reservoirs , but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. A low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. This portion of the river is known as Zink Lake. [39] [40] 

Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city has several prominent hills, such as "Shadow Mountain" and "Turkey Mountain", which create varied terrain, especially in its southern portions. While its central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, north of the city, is the tallest point in the Tulsa Metro area at 1360 ft (415 m) [41] According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 186.8 square miles (484 km 2 ), of which 182.6 square miles (473 km 2 ) of it is land and 4.2 square miles (11 km 2 ) of it (2.24%) is water. Cityscape [ edit ] Panoramic view of Tulsa Downtown and surrounding area from above the University of Tulsa in 2008 Architecture [ edit ] See also: List of tallest buildings in Tulsa and List of Art Deco buildings in Tulsa, Oklahoma The Philtower , built in the late Gothic Revival style, is surrounded by contemporary office buildings. 

A building boom in the early 20th century gave Tulsa one of the largest concentrations of art deco architecture in the United States. [42] Most commonly in the zigzag and streamline styles, [23] the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the Mid-Continent Tower , the Boston Avenue Methodist Church , and the Philtower , have attracted events promoting preservation and architectural interest. In 2001, Tulsa served as the host city for the International Art Deco Congress, a semiannual event designed to promote art deco architecture internationally. [43] 

In addition, the city's early prosperity funded the construction of a number of elegant Craftsman, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek Revival, Italianate, Spanish revival, and colonial revival homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa's uptown and Midtown neighborhoods). 

Building booms in later half of the twentieth century gave the city a larger base of contemporary architectural styles, including a number of buildings by famed architect Bruce Goff , who lived in Tulsa. South, East and Midtown tulsa are also home to a number of ranch and Mid-Century Modern homes that reflect Tulsa's prosperous post-war period. 

The BOK Tower , built during this period, is the 2nd tallest building in Oklahoma and the surrounding states of Missouri, New Mexico , Arkansas , and Kansas. [44] Tulsa also has the third-, and fourth-tallest buildings in the state, including the Cityplex Tower , which is located in South Tulsa across from Oral Roberts University, far from downtown. [45] One of the area's unique architectural complexes, Oral Roberts University, is built in a Post-Modern Futuristic style, incorporating bright gold structures with sharp, jetting edges and clear geometric shapes. The BOK Center , Tulsa's new arena, incorporates many of the city's most prominent themes, including Native American, art deco, and contemporary architectural styles. [46] Intended to be an architectural icon, [47] the building was designed by César Pelli , the architect of the Petronas Towers in Malaysia. Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Tulsa, Oklahoma 

Downtown Tulsa is an area of approximately 1.4 square miles (3.6 km 2 ) surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75. [48] The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the focus of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture. [49] Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the Tulsa Performing Arts Center , the Tulsa Convention Center , and the BOK Center . Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts district, the "Oil Capital Historic District", the Greenwood Historical District, Owen Park Historical Neighborhood, and the site of ONEOK Field , a baseball stadium for the Tulsa Drillers opened in 2010. [50] [51] [52] The Arkansas River marks the division between West Tulsa and other regions of the city. 

The city's historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to Greek Revival . The University of Tulsa, the Swan Lake neighborhood, Philbrook Museum , and the upscale shopping districts of Utica Square , Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, Woodland Hills Mall , as well as Southern Hills Country Club , and Oral Roberts University. East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large Asian and Mexican communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry. 

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called West Tulsa , and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to OSU-Tulsa , Gilcrease Museum , Tulsa International Airport , the Tulsa Zoo , the Tulsa Air and Space Museum , and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park. [53] Walkability [ edit ] 

A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Tulsa 32nd most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. [54] Climate [ edit ] 

Tulsa has a temperate climate of the humid subtropical variety ( Köppen Cfa ) with a yearly average temperature of 60.8 °F (16.0 °C) and an average precipitation of 41.0 inches (1,040 mm). [55] As is typical of temperate zones, weather patterns vary by season with occasional extremes in temperature and rainfall. [56] Lightning over downtown Tulsa is common in the spring months. 

Primarily in the spring and early summer months, the city is subjected to severe thunderstorms containing large hail , damaging winds, and, occasionally, tornadoes , [56] providing the area with a disproportionate share of its annual rainfall. [57] Severe weather is not limited to this season, however. For instance, on December 5, 1975, and on December 24, 1982, Tulsa experienced tornadoes. [56] Due to its potential for major flooding events, the city has developed one of the most extensive flood control systems in the nation. [58] A comprehensive flood management plan was developed in 1984 following a severe flood caused by a stalled weather front that dropped 15 in (380 mm) of rain overnight, killing 14, injuring 288, and destroying 7,000 buildings totaling $180 million in damage. [58] In the early 1990s [58] and again in 2000, [59] the Federal Emergency Management Agency honored Tulsa as leading the nation in flood plain management. 

On average, May is the wettest month, averaging 5.9 inches of rainfall. Triple-digit temperatures (≥38 °C) are observed on average 11 days per year, sometimes exceeding 105 °F (41 °C) from July to early September, [60] usually accompanied by high humidity brought in by southerly winds; [56] The highest recorded temperature recorded was 115 °F (46 °C) on August 10, 1936. [61] Lack of air circulation due to heat and humidity during the summer months leads to higher concentrations of ozone , prompting the city to release "Ozone Alerts", encouraging all parties to do their part in complying with the Clean Air Act and United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. [62] The autumn season is usually short, consisting of pleasant, sunny days followed by cool nights. [60] Winter temperatures, while generally mild, dip below 10 °F (−12 °C) on 3 nights, [55] and occasionally below 0 °F (−18 °C), the most recent such occurrence being a −2 °F (−19 °C) reading on January 6, 2014. [63] Seasonal snowfall averages 9.6 inches (24.4 cm), [55] and, as of 2016 [update] , only three winters on record have officially recorded a trace or no snow, the most recent being 1910–11. [63] The lowest recorded temperature was −16 °F (−27 °C) on January 22, 1930.

According to the 2010 Census , Tulsa had a population of 391,906 and the racial and ethnic composition was as follows: [1] White American : 62.6% (57.9% Non-Hispanic Whites , down from 85.7% in 1970) [68] African American : 15.6% Hispanic or Latino (of any race): 14.1% (11.5% Mexican , 0.4% Puerto Rican , 0.3% Guatemalan , 0.2% Spanish , 0.2% Honduran , 0.2% Salvadoran ) [1] Some other race: 8.0% Two or more races : 5.9% Native American : 5.3% Asian American : 2.3% (0.5% Indian , 0.4% Vietnamese , 0.3% Chinese , 0.2% Hmong , 0.2% Korean , 0.2% Burmese ) Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander : 0.1% Tulsa is sometimes considered the " buckle of the Bible Belt "; [69] it is the home of Oral Roberts University and the university's Prayer Tower . 

As of the 2010 census , there were 391,906 people, 163,975 households, and 95,246 families residing in the city, with a population density of 1,991.9 inhabitants per square mile (769.1/km 2 ). There were 185,127 housing units at an average density of 982.3 per square mile (379.2/km 2 ). Of 163,975 households, 27% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were married couples living together, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.9% were non-families.

[1] [70] Metropolitan area [ edit ] The Tulsa MSA's location (red) in the state of Oklahoma with the Tulsa-Bartlesville CSA (pink) Main article: Tulsa Metropolitan Area 

The Tulsa Metropolitan Area , or the region immediately surrounding Tulsa with strong social and economic ties to the city, [71] occupies a large portion of the state's northeastern quadrant. It is informally known as " Green Country ", a longstanding name adopted the state's official tourism designation for all of northeastern Oklahoma (its usage in relation to the Tulsa Metropolitan Area can be traced to the early part of the 20th century). [72] 

The Census Bureau defines the sphere of the city's influence as the Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), spanning seven counties: Tulsa, Rogers , Osage, Wagoner, Okmulgee , Pawnee , and Creek . The 2015 U.S. Census estimate shows the Tulsa MSA to have 981,005 residents [6] In 2015, U.S. Census estimates show the Tulsa-Muscogee-Bartlesville CMSA to have 1,151,172 residents. [73] [74] Religion [ edit ] 

Tulsa has a rich and diverse religious history, with notable and culturally significant communities of Christians, Jews, Muslims and others. 

Tulsa is part of the Southern region demographers and commentators refer to as the " Bible Belt ," where Protestant and, in particular, Southern Baptist and Evangelical Christian traditions are very prominent. In fact, Tulsa, home to Oral Roberts University , is sometimes called the " buckle of the Bible Belt ". [75] [76] Beyond Oral Roberts , number of prominent Protestant Christians have lived or studied in Tulsa, including Joel Osteen , Carlton Pearson , Kenneth Copeland , Billy Joe Daugherty , Smokie Norful and Billy James Hargis . Tulsa is also home to a number of vibrant Mainline Protestant congregations. Some of these congregations were founded during the oil boom of the early twentieth century and are noted for their architecture (such as the art deco Boston Avenue Methodist Church and First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa ). 

While the state of Oklahoma has fewer Roman Catholics than the national average, [77] Tulsa has a higher percentage owing in large part to the influx of Eastern and Midwestern settlers during the oil boom. Tulsa's Catholic community is atypically prominent for a Southern city and includes Governor and U.S. Senator Dewey F. Bartlett , Congressmen James Robert Jones and John A. Sullivan , Governor Frank Keating , U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Francis Rooney , and Mayors Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr. , Robert J. LaFortune , Bill LaFortune and G. T. Bynum . Holy Family Cathedral serves as the Cathedral for the Diocese of Tulsa. 

Tulsa is also home to the largest Jewish community in Oklahoma, with active Reform, Conservative and Orthodox congregations. [78] Tulsa's Jewish community includes several of America's most generous philanthropists including George Kaiser and Lynn Schusterman . Tulsa's Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art offers the largest collection of Judaica in the South-Central and Southwestern United States. 

Tulsa is also home to the progressive All Souls Unitarian Church , reportedly the largest Unitarian Universalist congregation in the United States. [79] [80] [81] Economy [ edit ] See also: List of companies based in Tulsa, Oklahoma The BOK Tower serves as the world headquarters for Williams Companies. Energy industry's legacy and resurgence [ edit ] 

Traditionally, Tulsa's economy has been led by the energy industry. The United States Oil and Gas Association , formerly the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association , was founded in Tulsa on October 13, 1917, six months after the entry of the United States into World War I . At the time Tulsa called itself "The Oil Capital of the World". At its creation, the association worked to provide petroleum to the Allied forces. In the decades since its establishment, the association is recognized as a leading advocate for producers of domestic oil and gas. [82] 

Over the city's history many large oil companies have been headquartered in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with Gulf Oil in what was then the largest merger in the energy industry), Skelly Oil , Getty Oil and CITGO . In addition, ConocoPhillips was headquartered in nearby Bartlesville. Industry consolidation and increased offshore drilling threatened Tulsa's status as an oil capital, but new drilling techniques and the rise of natural gas has buoyed the growth of the city's energy sector. 

Today, Tulsa is again home to the headquarters of many international oil and gas-related companies, including Williams Companies , SemGroup , ONE Gas , Syntroleum , ONEOK , Laredo Petroleum , Samson Resources , Helmerich Payne , Magellan Midstream Partners , WPX Energy , and Excel Energy. Diversification and emerging industries [ edit ] 

Tulsa has diversified to capitalize on its status as a regional hub with substantial innovation assets. Products from Tulsa manufacturers account for about 60% of Oklahoma's exports, [83] and in 2001, the city's total gross product was in the top one-third of metropolitan areas, states, and countries, with more than $29 billion in total goods, growing at a rate of $250 million each year. [84] In 2006, Forbes magazine rated Tulsa as second in the nation in income growth, and one of the best cities in the country to do business with. [85] Usually among the lowest in the nation in terms of cost of doing business, the Tulsa Metropolitan Area in 2005 was rated among the five lowest metropolitan areas in the United States for that category. [86] 

Tulsa's primary employer's are small and medium-sized businesses: there are 30 companies in Tulsa that employ more than 1,000 people locally, [87] and small businesses make up more than 80% of the city's companies. [88] 

During a national recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. [83] In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025 , promised to incite economic growth and recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights [83] [89] and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. [90] This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. [91] Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs have been added to the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%. [92] [93] 

Though the oil industry has historically dominated Tulsa's economy, efforts in economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of aerospace , finance, technology, telecommunications, high tech , and manufacturing. [9] A number of substantial financial corporations are headquartered in Tulsa, the largest being the BOK Financial Corporation . Among these financial services firms are energy trading operations, asset management firms, investment funds, and a range of commercial banks. The national convenience store chain QuikTrip , fast-casual restaurant chain Camille's Sidewalk Cafe , and pizza chain Mazzio's are all headquartered in Tulsa, as is Southern regional BBQ restaurant Rib Crib . Tulsa is also home to the Marshall Brewing Company . 

Tulsa is also home to a burgeoning media industry, including PennWell , video game developers 2015, Inc. , Stephens Media Group , This Land Press , Educational Development Corporation (the parent publisher of Kane/Miller ), GEB America , Blooming Twig Books , and a full range of local media outlets including such as Tulsa World and local magazines, radio and television. Tulsa is also a hub for national construction and engineering companies including Manhattan Construction Company and Flintco . A number of the Cherokee Nation Businesses are also headquartered or have substantial operations in Tulsa. 

Tulsa's aerospace industry is substantial and growing. An American Airlines maintenance base at Tulsa International Airport is the city's largest employer and the largest maintenance facility in the world, serving as the airline's global maintenance and engineering headquarters, [94] while the Tulsa Port of Catoosa and the Tulsa International Airport house extensive transit-focused industrial parks. [95] [96] Tulsa is also home to a division of Lufthansa , the headquarters of Omni Air International , and the Spartan School of Aeronautics . 

Tulsa is also part of the Oklahoma-South Kansas Unmanned Aerial Systems ( drone ) industry cluster, a region which awarded funding by the U.S. Small Business Administration to build on its progress as a hub this emerging industry. [97] 

As the second largest metropolitan area in Oklahoma and a hub for the growing Northeastern Oklahoma - Northwest Arkansas - Southwestern Missouri corridor, city is also home to a number of the region's most sophisticated law, accounting and medical practices. Its location in the center of the nation also makes it a hub for logistics businesses; the Tulsa International Airport (TUL) and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa, the nation's most inland seaport, connect the region with international trade and transportation. Culture [ edit ] 

Though Oklahoma is placed entirely in the Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau , [98] Tulsa is influenced by the nearby Southwest , Midwest , and Southern cultural regions, as well as a historical Native American presence. These influences are expressed in the city's museums, cultural centers, performing arts venues, ethnic festivals, park systems, zoos, wildlife preserves, and large and growing collections of public sculptures, monuments, and artwork. [99] Museums, archives and visual culture [ edit ] 

Tulsa is home to several internationally renowned museums. Located in the former villa of oil pioneer Waite Phillips in Midtown Tulsa, the Philbrook Museum of Art is considered one of the top 50 fine art museums in the United States, and is one of only five to offer a combination of a historic home, formal gardens, and an art collection. [100] The museum's expansive collection includes work by a diverse group of artists including Pablo Picasso , Andrew Wyeth , Giovanni Bellini , Domenico di Pace Beccafumi , Willem de Kooning , William Merritt Chase , Auguste Rodin and Georgia O'Keeffe . Philbrook also maintains a satellite campus in downtown Tulsa. 

In the Osage Hills of Northwest Tulsa, the Gilcrease Museum holds the world's largest, most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the American West,. [101] The museum includes the extensive collection of Native American oilman and famed art collector Thomas Gilcrease with numerous works by Frederic Remington , Thomas Moran , Albert Bierstadt and John James Audubon among the many displayed. 

In addition, the city hosts a number of galleries, experimental art-spaces, smaller museums and display spaces located throughout the city (clustered mostly in downtown, Brookside and the Pearl District). Living Arts of Tulsa, in downtown Tulsa, is among the organizations dedicated to promoting and sustaining an active arts scene in the city. 

Cultural and Historical Archives 

Opened in April 2013, the Woody Guthrie Center in the Brady Arts District is Tulsa's newest museum and archive. In addition to interactive state-of-the-art museum displays, the Woody Guthrie Center also houses the Woody Guthrie Archives, containing thousands of Guthrie's personal items, sheet music, manuscripts, books, photos, periodicals, and other items associated with the iconic Oklahoma native. [102] The archives of Guthrie protégé, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan will also be displayed in Tulsa when a new facility designed to showcase The Bob Dylan Archive is completed. 

With remnants of the Holocaust and artifacts relevant to Judaism in Oklahoma, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art preserves the largest collection of Judaica in the Southwestern and South-Central United States. [103] Other museums, such as the Tulsa Historical Society,the Tulsa Air and Space Museum Planetarium , the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, and the Tulsa Geosciences Center, document histories of the region, while the Greenwood Cultural Center preserves the culture of the city's African American heritage, housing a collection of artifacts and photography that document the history of the Black Wall Street prior to the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. Cyrus Dallin 's Appeal to the Great Spirit in Woodward Park 

Public Art 

Since 1969, public displays of artwork in Tulsa have been funded by one percent of its annual city budget. [99] Each year, a sculpture from a local artist is installed along the Arkansas River trail system, while other sculptures stand at local parks, such as an enlarged version of Cyrus Dallin 's Appeal to the Great Spirit sculpture at Woodward Park . [99] At the entrance to Oral Roberts University stands a large statue of praying hands, which, at 60 feet (18 m) high, is the largest bronze sculpture in the world. [104] As a testament to the city's oil heritage, the 76-foot (23 m) Golden Driller guards the front entrance to the Tulsa County Fairgrounds. The iconic Golden Driller, built in 1953 for the 1966 International Petroleum Exposition , [105] now stands at the Tulsa County Fairgrounds. Performing arts, film and cultural venues [ edit ] 

Tulsa contains several permanent dance, theater, and concert groups, including the Tulsa Ballet , the Tulsa Opera , the Tulsa Symphony Orchestra , Light Opera Oklahoma , Signature Symphony at TCC, the Tulsa Youth Symphony , the Heller Theatre , American Theatre Company , which is a member of the Theatre Communications Group and Oklahoma's oldest resident professional theatre, and Theatre Tulsa , the oldest continuously operating community theatre company west of the Mississippi River . [106] Tulsa also houses the Tulsa Spotlight Theater at Riverside Studio , which shows the longest-running play in America ( The Drunkard ) every Saturday night. Many of the world's best choreographers have worked with Tulsa Ballet including: Leonide Massine , Antony Tudor , Jerome Robbins , George Balanchine , Paul Taylor , Kurt Jooss , Nacho Duato (ten works), Val Caniparoli who is its resident choreographer (with seven works and four world premieres), Stanton Welch , Young Soon Hue , Ma Cong , Twyla Tharp and many others.

In March 2008, Tulsa Ballet was featured on the cover of Pointe magazine- a distinction given to only one ballet company each year. In April 2008, Tulsa Ballet completed an ambitious $17.3 million integrated campaign, which was celebrated at the opening of the brand new Studio K; an on-site, three hundred-seat performance space dedicated to the creation of new works. 

Tulsa's music scene is also famous for the eponymous " Tulsa Sound " which blends rockabilly, country, rock 'n' roll, and blues and has inspired local artists like J.J. Cale and Leon Russell as well as international superstars like Eric Clapton . 

A number of concert venues, dance halls and bars gave rise to the Tulsa Sound but Cain's Ballroom might be the best known. Cain's is considered the birthplace of Western Swing, [107] housed the performance headquarters of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys during the 1930s. The centerpiece of the downtown Brady Arts District, the Brady Theater , is the largest of the city's five operating performing arts venues that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . [108] Its design features extensive contributions by American architect Bruce Goff . 

Large performing arts complexes include the Tulsa Performing Arts Center , which was designed by World Trade Center architect Minoru Yamasaki , the Cox Business Center , the art deco Expo Square Pavilion , the Mabee Center , the Tulsa Performing Arts Center for Education, and the River Parks Amphitheater and Tulsa's largest venue, the BOK Center.

Outdoor attractions [ edit ] See also: List of festivals and events in Tulsa, Oklahoma The river parks trail system traverses the banks of the Arkansas River. 

The city's zoo, the Tulsa Zoo , was voted "America's Favorite Zoo" in 2005 by Microsoft Game Studios in connection with a national promotion of its Zoo Tycoon 2 computer game. [110] The zoo encompasses a total of 84 acres (34 ha) with over 2,600 animals representing 400 species. [111] The zoo is located in 2,820-acre (1,140 ha) Mohawk Park (the third largest municipal park in the United States) which also contains the 745-acre (301 ha) Oxley Nature Center. [53] [112] Tulsa's River Parks contain many monuments and attractions, such as these fountains. 

On the west bank of the Arkansas River in the suburb of Jenks , the Oklahoma Aquarium is the state's only freestanding aquarium, containing over 200 exhibits, including a shark tank. [113] 

The Tulsa State Fair , operating in late September and early October, attracts over one million people during its 10-day run, [114] and the city's Oktoberfest celebration was named one of the top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine. [115] A number of other cultural heritage festivals are held in the city throughout the year, including the Intertribal Indian Club Powwow of Champions in August; Scotstfest, India Fest, Greek Festival, and Festival Viva Mexico in September; ShalomFest in October; Dia de Los Muertos Art Festival in November; and the Asian-American Festival in May.

[116] On a smaller scale, the city hosts block parties during a citywide "Block Party Day" each year, with festivals varying in size throughout city neighborhoods. [117] Tulsa has one major amusement park attraction, Big Splash Water Park, featuring multi-story water slides and large wave pools. Until 2006, the city also hosted Bell's Amusement Park , which closed after Tulsa County officials declined to renew its lease agreement. [118] Tulsa Cuisine [ edit ] 

Tulsa restaurants and food trucks offer a number of cuisines, but several cuisines are particularly prominent in Tulsa's culinary landscape owing to its distinctive history. BBQ [ edit ] 

Tulsa is known nationally for its barbecue offerings; its barbecue reflects its midpoint location "between pig country and cow country," that is, on the border of the South and the West. [119] The city's barbecue is also helped by its geography; the wood used in barbecuing is abundant in Northeastern Oklahoma (including pecan , oak , hickory , mesquite and maple ). The region's ethnic diversity is felt, too: its BBQ traditions bear the influences of white, African-American and American Indian foodways. [120] Tulsa is also home to the nationally acclaimed premium smoker manufacturer Hasty-Bake Company. Some Tulsa based barbecue joints have expanded even beyond the state's borders, including Rib Crib and Billy Sims Barbecue . The prize-winning Oklahoma Joe's was founded by Oklahoman Joe Davidson, who mastered his craft at Tulsa's T-Town BBQ Cook-Off. [121] 

Oklahoma barbecue is also unique in its emphasis on hickory-smoked baloney, nicknamed "Oklahoma tenderloin" and its fried okra. [122] Lebanese Steakhouses [ edit ] 

Lebanese steakhouses were once numerous in the region stretching from Bristow, Oklahoma to Tulsa, but now mostly exist in the Tulsa region. [123] These restaurants were founded by Syrian and Lebanese families who immigrated to Oklahoma before statehood. [124] Traditionally, many of these restaurants had live entertainment (including performers like Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots ) and featured Mediterranean dishes like tabbouleh, rice pilaf and hummus alongside local favorites like smoked BBQ bologna. Chili and Coney Island Hot Dogs [ edit ] 

Oklahomans have been consuming chili since well before statehood, owing to the influence of Mexican-American culture on the state. [125] In 1910, iconic Tulsa restaurant Ike's Chili Parlor opened and Ivan "Ike" Johnson is purported to have acquired his recipe from a Hispanic-Texan named Alex Garcia. 

Greek immigrants to Tulsa who came by way of Brooklyn , Pennsylvania and Michigan brought with them the tradition of Coney Island-style hot dogs with chili on a bun. [126] Today, a related group of Greek-American families operate Coney restaurants around the city, including Coney I-Lander which opened in 1926 and was described by food writers Jane and Michael Stern as perfectly delivering "the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney's soul". [127] Many of these restaurants sell Greek food, either year round or at Tulsa's annual Greek Holiday, sponsored by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (which dates to 1925). [128] Southern "Homestyle" Food [ edit ] 

By and large, Tulsa's traditional cuisine reflects the influence of Southern foodways, particularly "upland South and... Texas where many of Oklahoma's nineteenth-century population originated." [129] The prominence of certain foods reflects the agricultural heritage of the surrounding regions. For instance, at the suggestion of experts at what is now Oklahoma State University , peanuts became a major crop in now eastern Oklahoma as a means for lessening the reliance on cotton cultivation. [130] Chicken-fried steak is part of the state meal of Oklahoma and is the signature dish at a number of Tulsa restaurants. [131] [132] Wild Onion Dinner [ edit ] 

The wild onion dinner is a festive gathering that originated with the Southeastern tribes which call Eastern Oklahoma. The meals often feature wild onion , pork , frybread , corn bread , Poke salad and a unique dish known as grape biscuits. [133] The Tulsa Indian Women's Club has been holding annual Wild Onion Dinners since at least 1932. [134] Sports [ edit ] The centerpiece of the Vision 2025 projects, the BOK Center, opened in August 2008. 

Tulsa supports a wide array of sports at the professional and collegiate levels. The city hosts two NCAA Division I colleges and multiple professional minor league sports teams in basketball, baseball, football, hockey, and soccer. [135] 

The city also contains one of the nation's top rated golf courses, Southern Hills Country Club , which is one of only two courses that have hosted seven men's major championships : three U.S. Opens and four PGA Championships , the most recent in 2007. [136] The course has held five amateur championships [136] and from 2001 to 2008 the LPGA had a regular tour stop, latterly known as the SemGroup Championship at Cedar Ridge Country Club. [137] In addition, Tulsa has two golf courses designed by famed golf course architect A.W. Tillinghast : the Oaks Country Club and Tulsa Country Club. 

The 19,199-seat BOK Center is the centerpiece of the Vision 2025 projects and was completed in August 2008; the BOK Center was in the top ten among indoor arenas worldwide in ticket sales for the first quarter of 2009 when it was the home for the city's WNBA , arena football , and hockey teams. [138] From 1978 to 1984, the city hosted the Tulsa Roughnecks , who played in the now-defunct North American Soccer League and won that league's championship in 1983. Also in 1984, the city hosted the Oklahoma Outlaws of the now-defunct United States Football League for a single season. [139] 

Tulsa has two universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level: the University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane, and the Oral Roberts University Golden Eagles. The University of Tulsa's men's basketball program has reached the Sweet Sixteen three times, made an appearance in the Elite Eight in 2000 , won the NIT championship in 1981 and 2001 , and won the inaugural College Basketball Invitational in 2008 . [140] [141] The Tulsa football team has played in 16 bowl games , including the Sugar Bowl (twice) and the Orange Bowl . [142] Oral Roberts University's men's basketball team reached the Elite Eight in 1974 and won the Mid-Continent Conference title three straight years, from 2005 to 2007. [143] 

The University of Tulsa also boasts one of the nation's top tennis facilities, the Michael D. Case Tennis Center , which was host to the 2004 and 2008 NCAA tennis championships.The Golden Hurricane Tennis program has string of success, including men's Missouri Valley championships in 1995 and 1996, men's Conference USA championships in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011 and women's Conference USA championships in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. In 2007, Tulsa's top-ranked player Arnau Brugués-Davi ranked as high as #1 in the nation and a four time All-American, advanced to the quarterfinals of the singles competition at the NCAA Men's Tennis Championship , improving on his 2006 round of sixteen appearance. 

At the secondary level, the Tulsa area is home to several high school athletic programs that are frequently ranked among the best nationally, particularly in football (e.g. Jenks High School ). [144] 

In 2008 Tulsa funded 39.2 million to build a new ballpark in the Greenwood District near downtown for its Class AA Texas League baseball team, the Tulsa Drillers. The ground breaking was held on December 19, 2008. ONEOK bought the naming rights for 10 million for the next 25 years. The first game at ONEOK Field was held on April 8, 2010. Country music star Tim McGraw threw out the first pitch. 

The city's running and cycling communities support events such as the Tulsa Tough cycling race, the Route 66 Marathon, [145] and the Tulsa Run , which features over 8000 participants annually. [146] Gambling is supported by a community of Indian gaming venues that have been allowed to expand gambling options. In 2005, compacts between the state and various tribes allowed facilities to offer table card games and slot machines. [147] Another popular gambling draw, Horse racing events are housed by the Fair Meadows Race Track and Will Rogers Downs in nearby Claremore . The University of Tulsa football team competes at the NCAA Division 1 level. 

In motor sports, Tulsa annually hosts the Chili Bowl indoor race at the Tulsa Expo Center . It is the largest event of its kind worldwide.

Government [ edit ] Main article: Government of Tulsa, Oklahoma See also: List of mayors of Tulsa, Oklahoma The Tulsa City Hall serves as the base for most city government functions. 

A mayor-council government has been in place in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. [150] Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. [150] Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr. who won the 2009 election and took office on December 7, 2009. [151] Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe , who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate , served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career. [152] 

A city councilor from each of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. The auditor is elected for a term of two years. [150] Phil Wood, a Democrat, held the position for 21 years before being defeated by Republican Preston Doerflinger in the 2009 election. [153] The city serves as the seat of county government for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within Oklahoma's 1st congressional district , with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district .

The Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) established the Presbyterian Mission Day School, a one-story building at what would become 4th Street and Boston Avenue in 1884. A second story was soon added to accommodate the number of children who were to attend. This school operated until 1889. [158] When Tulsa incorporated in 1899, it took over the school and became the first public school. James M. Hall and three other men bought the property with their own funds and held the title until the city could reimburse them. [158] [159] 

Tulsa built its first two public schools in 1905. Construction of more schools began accelerating in 1906. In December 1907, control of the public schools passed from the city government to the Tulsa Board of Education. [158] 

Tulsa High School opened in 1906 on the same block formerly occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was a three-story cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed Central High School . The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922. [160] This building remained in this service until 1976, when it was replaced by a new building on West Edison Street. The old building was taken over by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma. [158] 

There are three primary public school districts in the city of Tulsa. Tulsa Public Schools , with nine high schools and over 41,000 students, is the second-largest school district in Oklahoma [161] and includes Booker T.

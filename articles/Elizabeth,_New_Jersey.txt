History [ edit ] 

Elizabeth, originally called " Elizabethtown " and part of the Elizabethtown Tract , was founded in 1664 by English settlers. The town was not named for Queen Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret , one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of New Jersey. [26] [27] [28] She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital of New Jersey. [29] During the American Revolutionary War , Elizabethtown was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and Staten Island , culminating in the Battle of Springfield which decisively defeated British attempts to gain New Jersey. After independence, it was from Elizabethtown that George Washington embarked by boat to Manhattan for his 1789 inauguration. [30] There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in Elizabeth. [31] 

On March 13, 1855, the City of Elizabeth was created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature , combining and replacing both Elizabeth Borough (which dated back to 1740) and Elizabeth Township (which had been formed in 1693), subject to the results of a referendum held on March 27, 1855. On March 19, 1857, the city became part of the newly created Union County. Portions of the city were taken to form Linden Township on March 4, 1861. [32] 

The first major industry, the Singer Sewing Machine Company came to Elizabeth and employed as many as 2,000 people. In 1895, it saw one of the first car companies , when Electric Carriage and Wagon Company was founded to manufacture the Electrobat , joined soon by another electric car builder, Andrew L. Riker . The Electric Boat Company got its start building submarines for the United States Navy in Elizabeth, New Jersey, beginning with the launch of USS Holland (SS-1) in 1897. These pioneering naval craft [known as A-Class] were developed at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth between the years 1896–1903. [33] Elizabeth grew in parallel to its sister city of Newark for many years, but has been more successful in retaining a middle-class presence and was spared riots in the 1960s. 

On September 18, 2016, a backpack holding five bombs was discovered outside New Jersey Transit 's Elizabeth train station . One bomb detonated accidentally when a bomb squad robot failed to disarm the contents of the backpack; no one was hurt. Police were initially unsure if this event was related to bombs in Seaside Park, New Jersey and Manhattan that had exploded the previous day. [34] On September 19, police arrested Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old Afghan-born naturalized U.S. citizen , for questioning in connection with all three incidents ; the FBI considered Rahami, whose last known address was within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of the train station, to be armed and dangerous. [35] [36] Geography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city had a total area of 13.464 square miles (34.873 km 2 ), including 12.319 square miles (31.907 km 2 ) of land and 1.145 square miles (2.966 km 2 ) of water (8.51%). [1] [2] 

Elizabeth is bordered to the southwest by Linden , to the west by Roselle and Roselle Park , to the northwest by Union and Hillside , to the north by Newark (in Essex County ). To the east the city is across the Newark Bay from Bayonne in Hudson County and the Arthur Kill from Staten Island , New York . [37] 

Unincorporated communities , localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Elizabethport and Great Island. [38] 

The borders of Elizabeth, Bayonne, and Staten Island meet at one point on Shooters Island , of which 7.5 acres (3.0 ha) of the island is owned by Elizabeth, though the island is managed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . [39] Districts and neighborhoods [ edit ] 

The city of Elizabeth has several distinct districts and neighborhoods. Midtown / Uptown [ edit ] Art Deco Hersch Tower [40] Goethals Bridge 

Midtown also occasionally known as Uptown, is the main commercial district and a historic section as well. It includes the First Presbyterian Church and St. John's Episcopal Church , and its St. John's Episcopal Churchyard . The First Presbyterian Church was a battleground for the American Revolution. Located here are also the 1931 Art Deco Hersh Tower, [40] the Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy , and the Ritz Theatre which has been operating since 1926. Midtown/Uptown includes the area once known as "Brittanville" which contained many English type gardens. Bayway [ edit ] 

Bayway is located in the southern part of the city and borders the City of Linden. From US 1 9 and Allen Street, between the Elizabeth River and the Arthur Kill, it has maintained a strong Polish community for years. Developed at the turn of the 20th century, many of the area residents once worked at the refinery which straddles both Elizabeth and Linden. There are unique ethnic restaurants, bars, and stores along Bayway Avenue, and a variety of houses of worship. Housing styles are older and well maintained. There are many affordable two to four-family housing units, and multiple apartment complexes. The western terminus of the Goethals Bridge , which spans the Arthur Kill to Staten Island can be found here. A small section of the neighborhood was isolated with both the completion of the Goethals Bridge in 1928 and the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s. This section known as "Relocated Bayway" will soon be a memory and piece of history as many of the residents have been relocated themselves to make way for the expansion of the Goethals Bridge. DownTown / Elizabethport [ edit ] 

Downtown / E-Port (a.k.a. The Port and Elizabethport) is the oldest neighborhood in Elizabeth and perhaps the most diverse place in the city. It is a collection of old world Elizabeth, new America, and a mix of colonial-style houses and apartment buildings that stretch east of 7th Street to its shores. The name derived from its dependency of businesses catering to seagoing ventures. It was a thriving center of business between approximately the 1660s through the middle of the 20th century. This area has had a great deal of improvement in the last fifteen years. Many homes have been refurbished or replaced with new, more ornate constructions. Housing projects that stood for years along First Street were demolished and replaced with attractive apartment complexes for those with low to moderate incomes. New townhomes on the waterfront have been developed, and new two-family homes are currently under construction. The area formerly had three neighborhoods called Buckeye, New Mexico and Diamondville. 

It is the former home of the Singer Manufacturing Company , makers of Singer sewing machines, which constructed a 1,400,000-square-foot (130,000 m 2 ) facility on a 32-acre (13 ha) site in 1873. Shortly after it opened, the factory manufactured the majority of all sewing machines. With 6,000 employees working there in the 1870s, it was the largest number of workers at a single facility at the time of its construction. The company moved out in 1982. [41] 

The Elizabeth Marina, which in the past was filled with trash and debris along its walkway, was also beautified and many celebrations are held year round, from a Hispanic festival in the late spring to the lighting of a Christmas tree in the winter. Living conditions in this area continue to improve year after year. Historically, there was a Slavic community here, centered by a church (Sts. Peter and Paul Byzantine) and a Lithuanian (Sts. Peter and Paul, R.C.) and Polish (St. Adalbert) Roman Catholic Church still stands in the neighborhood. St. Patrick Church, originally Irish, dominates the 'Port and had its cornerstone laid in 1887. [42] Elmora and The West End [ edit ] Warinanco Park, Elmora 

Elmora is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the western part of Elizabeth. The main thoroughfare, Elmora Avenue, boasts some of the best restaurants, shops and boutiques. A few of the city's most luxurious high-rise building complexes, affording views of the New York skyline, dot the edge of this neighborhood and are convenient to the Midtown NJ Transit Train Station. The neighborhood area forms a "V" from its approximate borders of the Central RR tracks to Rahway Avenue. Immaculate Heart of Mary and St. Patrick's Church, Elizabethport Elmora Hills [ edit ] 

The northwestern part of Elmora is known as Elmora Hills. It is a strongly middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhood. Originally called Shearerville, the name Elmora came from the developers of the area, the El Mora Land Company. This area was annexed from Union, returning to Elizabeth in the early part of the 20th century. This was done to increase the city's tax base as major improvements to infrastructure were necessary at the time. Frog Hollow [ edit ] 

Frog Hollow is a small community of homes east of Atlantic Street, west of the Arthur Kill, and south of Elizabeth Avenue. Its name is derived from the excellent frog catching in its marshes as well as the excellent oyster and fishing of the past. The area expanded east and includes the area formerly known as Helltown. Helltown included many of the docks and shipyards, as well as several drydocks. The area's developer was Edward N. Kellogg, who also laid out the neighborhood in Keighry Head. Frog Hollow contains older-style, affordable homes, rentals, and some quality restaurants in a working-class community. The statue honoring former Mayor Mack on Elizabeth Avenue is a landmark in the community. Frog Hollow is also convenient to the Veteran's Memorial Waterfront Park. Keighry Head [ edit ] 

Its name is attributed to James Keighry of the Isle of Kerry, Ireland. He was a notable resident who owned a business facing the square formed at the junction of Jackson, Madison, Chestnut and Magnolia Avenues. The approximate borders of this neighborhood extended north from East Grand Street to Flora Street and from Walnut to Division Street. Developed by Edward N. Kellogg, many of the streets were named after family and friends. Keighry Head is located close to Midtown, containing affordable one and two-family homes, and apartment houses, convenient to the Midtown shopping district, and transportation. War monument; north Elizabeth North End / North Elizabeth [ edit ] 

The North End, also known as "North Elizabeth", is a diverse working-class neighborhood. The borders are approximately the Arch north to the city line between North Broad Street and US 1 9. It was developed mostly in the 1920s for workers in the Dusenburg automobile plant (later Durant Auto, Burry Biscuits and Interbake Foods). The area was heavily settled by the Irish and then Portuguese. The North End has easy access to New York and Newark via its own NJ Transit train station , Routes 1 9 and the NJ Turnpike. The neighborhood also has Crane Square, the Historic Nugents Tavern, and Kellogg Park and its proximity to Newark Airport. There is currently a plan in place to develop the former Interbake Foods facility into shopping and residential townhouses and condominiums. This community contains many larger one and two-family homes that have been rebuilt over the past decade. North Elizabeth also features many well-kept apartment houses and condominium units on and around North Avenue that are home to professionals who work in New York or the area. The only Benedictine women's community in New Jersey is located at Saint Walburga Monastery on North Broad Street. Peterstown [ edit ] 

Peterstown (also known as "The Burg") is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city. Its borders run west of Atlantic Street to South Spring Street from 1st Avenue to the Elizabeth River. Its name is derived from John Peters, who owned most of the land with George Peters. They divided the land and developed it during the end of the 19th century. The area of Peterstown was once predominantly occupied by its earliest settlers, who were German, and during the 1920s was gentrified by newly immigrated Italians. Peterstown has clean, quiet streets and has many affordable housing opportunities with a "village" feel. The area contains the historic Union Square, which is home to produce stands, meat markets, fresh fish and poultry stores. Peterstown is also home of the DeCavalcante crime family , one of the most infamous Mafia families in the United States. The Point / the Crossroads [ edit ] 

The Point, formally known as the Crossroads, is centrally located and defined by New Point Road and Division Street. It is close to Midtown and contains many new affordable two-family homes, apartment houses and is undergoing a transformation. The former Elizabeth General Hospital site is currently being demolished and awaiting a new development. Quality Hill [ edit ] 

Home to St. Mary's and the "Hilltoppers", this area once was lined with mansions. Its approximate borders were South Broad Street to Grier Avenue and Pearl Street to what is now US 1 9. During its development in the 1860s it was the most fashionable area of the city to live. It is now a quiet middle class community experiencing a re-development with many new condominiums. Westminster [ edit ] 

Developed by Edward J. Grassman, Westminster got its name from the city's largest residential estates of the Tudor style and was inhabited by many residents who traced their ancestry to England. This neighborhood borders Hillside with the Elizabeth River running its border creating a dramatic splash of greenery and rolling hills off of North Avenue, near Liberty Hall. Residents use this area for recreation, whether it is at the newly christened Phil Rizzuto Park area, or for bird watching or for sunbathing by the river. It is one of the more affluent areas of Elizabeth. Climate [ edit ] 

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and cold winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Elizabeth has a humid subtropical climate , abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.

[58] [59] Economy [ edit ] Industrial "backyard" east of Elizabeth, New Jersey 

Since World War II , Elizabeth has seen its transportation facilities grow; the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal is one of the busiest ports in the world, as is Newark Liberty International Airport , parts of which are actually in Elizabeth. Elizabeth also features Little Jimmy's Italian Ices (since 1932), the popular Jersey Gardens outlet mall , Loews Theater , and the Elizabeth Center , which generate millions of dollars in revenue. Companies based in Elizabeth include New England Motor Freight . 

Together with Linden , Elizabeth is home to the Bayway Refinery , a Phillips 66 refining facility that supplies petroleum -based products to the New York /New Jersey area, producing approximately 230,000 barrels (37,000 m 3 ) per day. 

Celadon, a mixed-use development containing 14 glass skyscrapers, offices, retail, a hotel, boardwalk and many other amenities is proposed to border the east side of the Jersey Gardens mall, directly on the Port Newark Bay. Groundbreaking was scheduled for the summer of 2008 on the ferry, roads and parking, and construction will continue for at least twelve years. [64] 

Portions of the city are covered by the Urban Enterprise Zone , which cuts the sales tax rate to 3½% (half of the 7% charged statewide) and offers other incentives to businesses within the district. [65] The Elizabeth UEZ has the highest business participation rate in the state, with approximately 1,000 businesses participating in — and benefiting from — the program. The UEZ has helped bring in more than $1.5 billion in new economic development to the city and has brought in over $50 million in sales tax revenue that has been reinvested in funding for additional police, streetscape and other infrastructure improvements.

The Elizabeth Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city of Elizabeth. [110] The Elizabeth Fire Department was established as a volunteer organization in 1837 when Engine Company # 1 was organized. In 1901, the volunteer department was no longer adequate and the department reorganized into a paid department on January 1, 1902. [111] 

The department is part of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which consists of nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency services divisions working to address major emergency rescue situations.

The city's public schools are operated by Elizabeth Public Schools , serving students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade . The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide, [113] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority . [114] [115] 

As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's 34 schools had an enrollment of 23,386 students and 1,846.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.67:1. [116] 

With 5,300 students, Elizabeth High School was the largest high school in the state of New Jersey and one of the largest in the United States, and underwent a split that created five new academies and a smaller Elizabeth High School under a transformation program that began in the 2009–10 school year. [117] The school was the 294th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2010 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 302nd in 2008 out of 316 schools. [118] Before the 2008–09 school year, all of the district's schools (except high schools) became K–8 schools, replacing the middle schools and elementary schools. SchoolDigger.com ranked Elizabeth 449th of 558 districts evaluated in New Jersey. [119] 

These and other indicators reveal a seriously declining performance standard in the city's schools. Data reported by the state Department of Education showed that a majority of students in a majority of the Elizabeth public schools failed basic skills tests. [120] 

In the 2008–09 school year, Victor Mravlag Elementary School No. 21 was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education , [121] the highest award an American school can receive. [122] [123] For the 2006–07 school year, William F. Halloran Alternative School #22 was one of four schools in New Jersey recognized with the Blue Ribbon Award. [124] William F. Halloran Alternative School #22 earned a second award when it was one of 11 in the state to be recognized in 2014 by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program. [125] [126] [127] Private schools [ edit ] 

Elizabeth is also home to several private schools. The coeducational St. Mary of the Assumption High School , which was established 1930, [128] and the all-girls Benedictine Academy , which is run by the Benedictine Sisters of Saint Walburga Monastery, [129] both operate under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark . [130] The Newark Archdiocese also operates the K–8 schools Our Lady of Guadalupe Academy and St. Genevieve School. [131] 

Following the closure of Saint Patrick High School by the Newark Archdiocese in June 2012 in the face of increasing costs and declining enrollment, administrators and parents affiliated with the defunct school opened an independent non-denominational school located on Morris Avenue in Elizabeth called "The Patrick School" in September 2012. [132] [133] [134] 

The Benedictine Preschool, operated by the Benedictine Sisters, is housed at Saint Walburga Monastery. [135]

[140] 

Elizabeth was once home to several smaller bascule bridges . The South First Street Bridge over the Elizabeth River, originally built in 1908, was replaced by a fixed span. The South Front Street Bridge (also over the Elizabeth River), built in 1922, has been left in the open position since March 2011. [141] A study is underway to determine if the bridge can be rehabilitated. [142] The bridge is notable in that it is the only remaining movable road bridge in Union County (movable railroad bridges still exist).

[144] 

New Jersey Transit has planned a segment of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link (NERL), designated as the Union County Light Rail (UCLR). The UCLR was planned to connect Midtown Station with Newark Liberty International Airport and have seven or eight other stations in between within Elizabeth city limits. [145] [146] A possible extension of this future line to Plainfield would link the city of Elizabeth with the Raritan Valley Line . 

New Jersey Transit provides bus service on the 111 , 112 , 113 and 115 routes to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan , on the 24 , 40 , 48 , 59 and 62 routes to Newark, New Jersey , with local service available on the 26 , 52 , 56 , 57 and 58 routes. [147]

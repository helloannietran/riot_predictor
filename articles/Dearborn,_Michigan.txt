Dearborn is a city in the State of Michigan . It is located in Wayne County and is part of the Detroit metropolitan area . Dearborn is the eighth largest city in the State of Michigan . As of the 2010 census , it had a population of 98,153. [5] First settled in the late 18th century by French farmers in a series of ribbon farms along the Rouge River and the Sauk Trail , the community grew with the establishment of the Detroit Arsenal on the Chicago Road linking Detroit and Chicago. It later grew into a manufacturing hub for the automotive industry. 

The city was the home of Henry Ford and is the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company . It has a campus of the University of Michigan as well as Henry Ford Community College . Dearborn has The Henry Ford , the United States' largest indoor-outdoor museum complex and Metro Detroit 's leading tourist attraction. [6] [7] 

Dearborn residents are primarily of European or Middle Eastern heritage, descendants of 19th and 20th-century immigrants. German , Polish , Irish and Italian are the primary European ethnicities.

History [ edit ] 

The area had been inhabited for thousands of years by varying indigenous peoples . Historical tribes belonged mostly to the Algonquian -language family, although the Huron were Iroquoian speaking. French colonists had a trading post and developed Detroit during the colonial period, trading with numerous regional tribes. This settlement was ceded to Britain in 1763 after its victory in the Seven Years' War. 

The Dearborn area was settled permanently by Europeans in 1786, after the American Revolutionary War . [8] Population growth led to Dearborn Township being formed in 1833 and the village of Dearbornville within it being established in 1836, both named after patriot Henry Dearborn , a General in the American Revolution and Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson . The town of Dearborn was incorporated in 1893. 

In 1927 it was established as a city. Its current borders result from a 1928 consolidation vote that merged Dearborn and neighboring Fordson (previously known as Springwells ), which feared being absorbed into Detroit. 

The area between the two towns was, and still remains in part, undeveloped. Once farm land, this was bought by Henry Ford for his estate, Fair Lane , and the Ford Motor Company World Headquarters. Later developments in this corridor were the Ford airport (later converted to the Dearborn Proving Grounds ), other Ford administrative and development facilities, The Henry Ford (the region's leading tourist attraction containing a reconstructed historic village and museum), the Henry Ford Centennial Library , the super-regional shopping mall Fairlane Town Center , and the Dearborn Civic Center. The open land is planted with sunflowers and often with Henry Ford's favorite soybeans . The crops are never harvested. 

The Arab American National Museum (AANM) opened in Dearborn in 2005, the first museum in the world devoted to Arab-American history and culture. Arab Americans in Dearborn include ethnic Lebanese Christians who immigrated in the early twentieth century to work in the auto industry as well as more recent Arab immigrants from other nations. Geography [ edit ] Parklane Towers 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 24.5 square miles (63 km 2 ), of which 24.4 square miles (63 km 2 ) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km 2 ) (0.37%) is water. The Rouge River runs through the city with an artificial waterfall/low head dam on the Henry Ford estate to power its powerhouse. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Branches of the river come together in Dearborn. The river is widened and channeled near the Rouge Plant to allow lake freighter access. 

Fordson Island ( 42°17′38″N 83°08′52″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.29389°N 83.14778°W ﻿ / 42.29389; -83.14778 ) is an 8.4 acre (33,994 m²) island about three miles (5 km) inland from the Detroit River on the River Rouge . Fordson Island is the only major island in a tributary to the Detroit River. The island was created in 1922 when engineers dug a secondary trench to reroute the River Rouge to increase navigability for shipping purposes. The island is privately owned, and public access is prohibited. The island is part of the city of Dearborn, which has no frontage along the Detroit River. [9] [10] 

Dearborn is among a small number of municipalities that own property in other cities. It owns the 626-acre (2.53 km 2 ) Camp Dearborn in Milford , Michigan , which is located 35 miles (56 km) from Dearborn. [11] Dearborn was among an even smaller number that hold property in another state: the city owned the "Dearborn Towers" apartment complex in Clearwater , Florida , but it has been sold. Camp Dearborn is considered part of the city of Dearborn, and revenues generated by camp admissions are used to bolster the city's budget.

Dearborn Public Library includes the Henry Ford Centennial Library , the main library, and the Bryant and Esper branches. [38] 

The Bryant Branch, which opened in November 1924, was Dearborn's first public library. It served as the main library until the Ford library opened in 1969, and 1970 Bryant (then known as the Mason branch) became a branch library. The library was renamed in 1977 after Katharine Wright Bryant, who developed a plan for the library and campaigned for it. [39] 

Around April 1963 the Ford Motor Company granted the City of Dearborn $3,000,000 to build a library as a memorial to Henry Ford . Ford Motor Company deeded 15.3 acres (6.2 ha) of vacant land for the public library to the city on July 30, 1963, the centennial or 100th anniversary of Henry Ford's birth. The Ford Foundation later granted the library an additional $500,000 for supplies and equipment. On November 25, 1969 the library was dedicated. Library employees occupied the building since its opening; originally only the library had offices in the building. In 1979 the library staff gave up the western side's meeting rooms, and the City of Dearborn Health Department occupied those rooms. [40] 

The Esper Branch, the smallest branch, is located in what is known as the Arab residential quarter of the city. The library has about 35,000 books, entertainment and educational videocasettes, music CDs, children's music cassettes, audio books, and magazines. Newspapers are available there. It features many Arabic-language books, newspapers, and videocasettes for its Arabic-speaking residents. It was dedicated on October 12, 1953. Originally named the Warren Branch, the library had replaced the Northeast Branch, which opened in a storefront in 1944. In October 1961 it was named after city councilman Anthony M. Esper.

[48] In a separate civil trial , the City of Dearborn was found to have violated the constitutional rights of the defendants, with the city later settling the lawsuit and issuing a formal apology. [49] 

A Republican senatorial candidate in Nevada, Sharron Angle , suggested that Dearborn was contributing to a non-widespread "militant terrorist situation," [50] [51] and said that the city was enforcing Islamic law. [50] Angle was sharply criticized by the Mayor Jack O'Reilly, who called her comments "shameful." [50] He said they were based on distorted Tea Party accounts of the arrest of members of an anti-Islam group at an Arab festival. [50] 

Preacher Terry Jones planned a protest in 2011 outside the Islamic Center of America . Local authorities required him either to post a $45,000 "peace bond" to cover Dearborn's cost if Jones incited violence or to go to trial. Jones contested that requirement he and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp refused to post the bond. They were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment rights. That night Jones was released by the court. [52] The ACLU had filed an amicus brief in support of Jones's protest plans. [53] A week later, on April 29, Jones led a rally at the Dearborn City Hall, designated as a free speech zone. Riot police were called out to control counter protesters. [54] [55] [56] Terry Jones led a rally at City Hall and then planned to speak at the annual Festival on June 18, 2011, but on his way there he was blocked by protesters, six of whom were arrested. Police said they did not have enough officers present to maintain safety. [57] Christian missionaries accompanied Jones with their own signs of protest; they were alleged by festivalgoers and protesters to have yelled insults at Arabs, Muslims, Islam, and Catholics. [58] On November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the "breach of peace" ruling against Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process. [59] On April 7, 2012 Terry Jones led a protest in front of the Islamic Center of America, Dearborn, speaking about Islam and Free Speech. The mosque was placed on lock down. 30 police cars were there to block traffic and prevent a counter protest.

Zhengzhou is a Chinese city and the provincial capital of Henan Province in east- central China . [2] As a prefecture-level city , it also serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational centre of the province, as well as a major transportation hub for Central China. The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River , and is one of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China . [3] 

Zhengzhou has a population of 9,378,000 inhabitants with an urban population of 6,406,000, [4] the city is one of the main built up areas of Henan region. [5] Zhengzhou is now a rapidly growing city. 

Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging megacities or megalopolises in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit . [6]

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Zhengzhou 

The Shang dynasty established Aodu ( 隞都 ) or Bodu ( 亳都 ) in Zhengzhou. [7] This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Neolithic Shang dynasty settlements in the area. [8] [9] Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. [10] Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111–771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan . From this derives the name borne by the county ( xian ) since the late 6th century BC— Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou . In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou—a name by which it has been known virtually ever since. [11] 

The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 581), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty . It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581–618), Tang (618–907), and early Song (960–1127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal , which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance. It was a capital during the five dynasties of Xia, Shang, Guan, Zheng, and Han, and a prefecture during the eight dynasties of Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. [ citation needed ] 

In 1903 the Beijing – Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east–west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang , Jiangsu , and westward to Xi'an ( Chang'an ), Shaanxi , as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts , and other agricultural produce. [ citation needed ] Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese ; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese. [12] 

Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. [ citation needed ] The city has an agricultural university. Administration and demography [ edit ] 

Zhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts , 5 county-level cities and 1 county . These subdivisions are likely to undergo a significant change in the near future due to rapid urban expansion and urban planning. 

The municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and over four million in its built up area, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province. [5] Map Jinshui Erqi Huiji Guancheng Zhongyuan Shangjie Xingyang

Located just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River , Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north–south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34° 16' ~ 34° 58 N latitude and 112° 42' ~ 114° 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km 2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi). 

The section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmou is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions. Climate [ edit ] 

Zhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification Cwa ), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.35 °C (57.8 °F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.1 °C (32.2 °F) in January to 27.0 °C (80.6 °F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −17.9 °C (0 °F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 °C (109 °F) on 19 July 1966. [13] [14] 

Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.

As air pollution in China is at an all-time high, several northern cities are among one of the most polluted cities and has one of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's Airpocalypse has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by "Global voices China" in February 2013, Zhengzhou is among China's 10 most polluted cities. Other cities on the blacklist includes major Chinese cities like Beijing , Jinan , Shijiazhuang , and 6 other prefectural cities all in Hebei Province. [17] 

According to a report by Greenpeace in 2015, Henan (the province that Zhengzhou is in) has the most severe air pollution in among all the provinces in China with an average PM2.5 concentration of 103.3μg/m3. Ranking second and third respectively are provinces of Hubei and Hebei , with PM2.5 concentrations of 99.2μg/m3 and 98.4μg/m3. [18] 

Zhengzhou is the fourth most polluted city air-wise in China, with PM2.5 concentration of 134.7μg/m3 (over 13 times the safe limit established by the WHO) during the first quarter of 2015. Other cities in Henan that ranked within the top 30 most polluted cities in China during the first quarter of 2015 include Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, Anyang, Pingdingshan, Zhoukou, Xuchang, Puyang, and Luoyang; all with PM2.5 concentrations above 100μg/m3.

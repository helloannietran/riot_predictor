Luton ( i / ˈ l uː t ən / LOOT -ən , [4] local / ˈ l uː ʔ ən / ) is a large town, borough and unitary authority area of Bedfordshire , England. Luton and its near neighbours, Dunstable and Houghton Regis , form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area with a population of about 258,000. [5] [6] It is located 20 miles (30 km) east of Aylesbury , 14 miles (20 km) west of Stevenage , 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of London , and 22 miles (40 km) southeast of Milton Keynes . 

Luton is home to League Two team Luton Town Football Club , whose history includes several spells in the top flight of the English league as well as a Football League Cup triumph in 1988. They play at Kenilworth Road stadium, which has been their home since 1905. 

London Luton Airport , opened in 1938, is one of England's major airports. During the Second World War it doubled as an RAF base. 

The University of Bedfordshire is based in the town. 

The Luton Carnival , which was traditionally been held on the Whitsun May bank holiday , is the largest one-day carnival in Europe. [7] In 2012, it was moved to July to coincide with the Olympic Torch Relay and celebrations. Luton Carnival was transferred from Luton Borough Council to UK Centre for Carnival Arts in 2013, and since then has been held on the Sunday before the bank holiday in order to avoid the increased costs of operating on a bank holiday. 

The town was for many years famous for hat-making , and also had a large Vauxhall Motors factory. Car production at the plant began in 1905 and continued until 2002. Production of commercial vehicles continues, and the head office of Vauxhall Motors is still situated in the town.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Luton Etymology [ edit ] 

Luton derives its name from Saxon -tun (meaning enclosure, estate or homestead), and the Brittonic element -lug (meaning 'bright', 'light' or referring to the associated Celtic deity Lugus ). The joint linguistic heritage may indicate the town's foundation as an early Anglo-Saxon outpost in a newly conquered area . [8] [9] Early history [ edit ] 

The earliest settlements in the Luton area were at Round Green and Mixes Hill, where Paleolithic encampments (about 250,000 years old) have been found. [10] Settlements re-appeared after the ice had retreated in the Mesolithic period around 8000 BC. Traces of these settlements have been found [ by whom? ] in the Leagrave area of the modern town. Remains from the Neolithic period (4500–2500 BC in this area) are much more common. A particular concentration of Neolithic burials occurs at Galley Hill. [11] The most prominent Neolithic structure is Waulud's Bank – a henge dating from around 3000 BC. From the Neolithic onwards, the area seems to have been populated, but without any single large settlement. Luton itself is believed to have been founded as Lea-tun by the Anglo-Saxons sometime in the 6th century. [12] 

After the establishment of the Danelaw in the east of England and the unification of the remaining English kingdoms in the west, Luton stood on the border between Christendom and Heathenism which ran up the River Lea from London through to Bedford. [13] 

The Anglo Saxon Chronicle for the year 913 mentions Luton because locals fought off a Viking raiding band: "In this year the [Danish] army from Northampton and Leicester rode out after Easter [28th March] and broke the peace, and killed many men at Hook Norton [Oxfordshire] and round about there. And then very soon after that, as the one force came home, they met another raiding band which rode out against Luton. And then the people of the district became aware of it and fought against them and reduced them to full flight and rescued all that they had captured and also a great part of their horses and their weapons". [13] 

Archaeological finds for this genesis of Lutonian history include 50 burials, 8 cremations, 16 spears, 22 knives ( seax ), a sword, 8 shield bosses, a pair of iron shears, a single bone comb, countless examples of brooches, pendants and other jewellery of bronze and amber and shards of pottery. [14] 

The Domesday Book records Luton as Loitone and also as Lintone . [15] Agriculture dominated the local economy at that time, and the town's population was around 700 to 800. [16] But this number could [ original research? ] represent a recently reduced population as a direct result of the Norman Invasion and the English resistance that followed. The Domesday Book records the value of King William's English possessions 20 years after his victory at Hastings, during which period, as the book would suggest, much destruction and death took place. Besides Luton, Biscot and Caddington also have entries in the Domesday Book for the surrounding area and in both these cases the value of the lands are much lower than their pre-invasion state, indicating a loss of households, livestock and crops. [17] [18] St Mary's Church , Luton town centre The Wenlock chapel within St Mary's 

In 1121 Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester started work on St Mary's Church in the centre of the town. The work was completed by 1137. [19] A motte-and-bailey castle which gives its name to the modern Castle Street was built in 1139. The castle was demolished in 1154 [20] and the site is now occupied by a Matalan store. During the Middle Ages Luton is recorded [ by whom? ] as having six watermills . Mill Street, in the town centre , takes its name from one of them. 

King John (1166–1216) had hired a mercenary soldier, Falkes de Breauté , to act on his behalf. (Breauté is a small town near Le Havre in France.) When he married, Falkes de Breauté acquired his wife's house which came to be known as "Fawkes Hall", subsequently corrupted over the years to "Foxhall", then to " Vauxhall ". In return for his services, King John granted Falkes the manor of Luton, where he built a castle alongside St Mary's Church . He was also granted the right to bear his own coat of arms and chose the mythical griffin as his heraldic emblem. The griffin thus became associated with both Vauxhall and Luton in the early 13th century. [21] 

By 1240 the town is recorded as "Leueton". One "Simon of Luton" was Abbot of Bury St Edmunds from 1257 to 1279. The town had a market for surrounding villages in August each year, and with the growth of the town a second fair was granted each October from 1338. 

In 1336 a large fire destroyed much of Luton; however, the town was soon rebuilt. 

The agriculture base of the town changed in the 16th century with a brick-making industry developing around Luton; many of the older wooden houses were rebuilt in brick. 17th century [ edit ] 

During the English Civil War of the 17th century, in 1645, royalists entered the town and demanded money and goods. Parliamentary forces arrived and during the fighting four royalist soldiers were killed and a further twenty-two were captured. A second skirmish occurred three years later in 1648 when a royalist army passed through Luton. A number of royalists were attacked by parliamentary soldiers at an inn on the corner of the current Bridge Street. Most of the royalists escaped but nine were killed. 18th century [ edit ] 

The hat making industry began in the 17th century and became synonymous with the town. [22] By the 18th century the industry dominated the town. Hats are still produced in the town but on a much smaller scale. 

The first Luton Workhouse was constructed in the town in 1722. [23] 

Luton Hoo , a nearby large country house , was built in 1767 and substantially rebuilt after a fire in 1843. It is now a luxury hotel. [24] 19th century [ edit ] A map of Luton from 1888 

The town grew strongly in the 19th century. In 1801 the population was 3,095. [25] By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. Such rapid growth demanded a railway connection but the town had to wait a long time for one. The London and Birmingham Railway (L BR) had been built through Tring in 1838, and the Great Northern Railway was built through Hitchin in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L BR at Leighton Buzzard was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, construction terminated at Dunstable in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to Bute Street Station , and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858. [26] The line was later extended to Welwyn and from 1860 direct trains to King's Cross ran. The Midland Railway was extended from Bedford to St Pancras through Leagrave and Midland Road station and opened on 9 September 1867. [27] 

Luton received a gas supply in 1834. Gas street lights were erected and the first town hall was opened in 1847. [28] 

Following a cholera epidemic in 1848 Luton established a water company and had a complete water and sewerage system by the late 1860s. Newspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854. The first public cemetery was opened in the same year. The first covered market was built (the Plait Halls – now demolished) in 1869. Luton was made a borough in 1876. [29] A professional football club – the first in the South of England – was founded in 1885 following a resolution at the town hall that a 'Luton Town Club be formed'. [30] 

The crest also includes a hand holding a bunch of wheat, either taken as a symbol of the straw-plaiting industry, or from the arms of John Whethamsteade, Abbott of St Albans , who rebuilt the chancel of St Mary's Church in the 15th century. 20th century [ edit ] Luton Museum Art Gallery in Wardown Park 

In the 20th century, the hat trade severely declined and was replaced by other industries. In 1905, Vauxhall Motors opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton. In 1914 Hewlett Blondeau aviation entrepreneurs built a factory in Leagrave which began aircraft production built under licence for the war effort; the site was purchased in 1920 by new proprietors Electrolux domestic appliances, and this was followed by other light engineering businesses. 

In 1901 the Bailey Water Tower was built [31] on the edge of what was to become Luton Hoo memorial park. It is now a private residence. 

In 1904 councillors Asher Hucklesby and Edwin Oakley purchased the estate at Wardown Park and donated it to the people of Luton. Hucklesby went on to become Mayor of Luton. The main house in the park became Wardown Park Museum . 

The town had a tram system from 1908 until 1932, and the first cinema was opened in 1909. By 1914 the population had reached 50,000. 

The original town hall was destroyed in 1919 during Peace Day celebrations at the end of the First World War . Local people, including many ex-servicemen, were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events. They stormed the town hall, setting it alight ( see Luton Town Hall ). A replacement building was completed in 1936. Luton Airport opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council. The first town hall was destroyed in 1919 

The pre-war years, even at the turn of the 1930s when a Great Depression saw unemployment reach record levels nationally, were something of an economic boom for Luton, as new industries grew and prospered. New private and council housing was built in the 1920s and 1930s, with Luton growing as a town to incorporate nearby villages Leagrave , Limbury and Stopsley between 1928 and 1933. [32] 



In the Second World War , the Vauxhall Factory built Churchill tanks [33] as part of the war effort . Despite heavy camouflage, the factory made Luton a target for the Luftwaffe and the town suffered a number of air raids . 107 died [34] and there was extensive damage to the town (over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed). Other industry in the town, such as SKF , which produced ball bearings , made a vital contribution to the war effort. Although a bomb landed at the SKF Factory, [35] no major damage was caused. Post-war, the slum clearance continued, and a number of substantial estates of council housing were built, notably at Farley Hill , Stopsley , Limbury , Marsh Farm and Leagrave ( Hockwell Ring ). The M1 motorway passed just to the west of the town, opening in 1959 and giving it a direct motorway link with London and – eventually – the Midlands and the North. In 1962 a new library (to replace the cramped Carnegie Library ) was opened by the Queen in the corner of St George's Square. 

In the late 1960s a large part of the town centre was cleared to build a large covered shopping centre, the Arndale Centre , which was opened in 1972. [36] It was refurbished and given a glass roof in the 1990s. The town centre still has some of the old hat factories 

In 2000, Vauxhall announced the end of car production in Luton; the plant closed in March 2002. [37] At its peak it had employed in excess of 30,000 people. Vauxhall's headquarters remain in the town, as does its van and light commercial vehicle factory. 21st century [ edit ] 

A major regeneration programme for the town centre is under way, which will include upgrades to the town's bus and railway stations as well as improvements to the town's urban environment. St George's Square has been rebuilt [38] and reopened in 2007. The new design won a Gold Standard Award for the Town Centre Environment from the annual British Council of Shopping Centres awards. [39] 

Work was completed on an extension to the Mall Shopping Centre facing St George's Square, the largest of the new units to was taken by TK Maxx . Planning applications for a much larger extension to the Mall Arndale Shopping Centre (In the Northern Gateway area – Bute Street, Silver Street and Guildford Street) and also for a new centre in Power Court [40] (close to St Mary's Church ) have been submitted. On the edge of Luton at Putteridge Bury a high-technology office park, Butterfield Green , is under construction. The former Vauxhall site is also to be re-developed as a mixed use site called Napier Park. [41] It will feature housing, retail and entertainment use, including a new casino . Governance [ edit ] Logo of Luton Unitary Authority 

The town is situated within the historic county of Bedfordshire , but since 1997 Luton has been an administratively independent unitary authority . The town remains part of Bedfordshire for ceremonial purposes. 

Luton Borough Council applied for city status at the Millennium in 2000, Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002 and Diamond Jubilee in 2012. [42] The latest bid was rejected in March 2012. [43] Parliamentary representation [ edit ] Main article: Politics in Luton 

Luton is represented by two Members of Parliament . The constituency of Luton North has been held by Kelvin Hopkins (Labour) since 1997. Luton South has been held by Gavin Shuker (Labour) since 2010. Luton is within the East of England European Parliament constituency. Police and crime commissioner [ edit ] 

Luton is served by the Bedfordshire police . The Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner is Kathryn Holloway . Local council [ edit ] 

Lutonians are governed by Luton Borough Council . The town is split into 19 wards , represented by 48 councillors. Elections are held for all seats every four years, with the most recent local elections held in May 2011 and the next due in May 2015. The Council is controlled by the Labour group, who have 36 Local Councillors (a majority of 24). The next largest party is the Liberal Democrats with 8 seats, followed by the Conservative Party with 4 seats. [44] Position Current representatives Members of Parliament Kelvin Hopkins , Labour , elected 1997 · Gavin Shuker , Labour, elected 2010 Luton Council coat of arms [ edit ] Luton Borough Council coat of arms: granted 25 July 1876 

In 1876 the town council was granted its own coat of arms . The wheatsheaf was used on the crest to represent agriculture and the supply of straw used in the local hatting industry (the straw-plaiting industry was brought to Luton by a group of Scots under the protection of Sir John Napier of Luton Hoo ). The bee is traditionally the emblem of industry and the hive represents the straw-plaiting industry for which Luton was famous. The rose is from the arms of the Napier family, whereas the thistle is a symbol for Scotland . An alternative suggestion is that the rose was a national emblem, and the thistle represents the Marquess of Bute , who formerly owned the Manor of Luton Hoo.

Luton is located in a break in the Eastern part of the Chiltern Hills . The Chilterns are a mixture of chalk from the Cretaceous period [47] (about 66 – 145 million years ago) and deposits laid at the southernmost points of the ice sheet during the last ice age (the Warden Hills area can be seen from much of the town). 

Bedfordshire had a reputation for brick making but the industry is now significantly reduced. The brickworks [48] at Stopsley took advantage of the clay deposits in the east of the town. 

The source of the River Lea , part of the Thames Valley drainage basin , is in the Leagrave area of the town. The Great Bramingham Wood surrounds this area. It is classified as ancient woodland ; records mention the wood at least 400 years ago. 

There are few routes through the hilly area for some miles, this has led to several major roads (including the M1 and the A6 ) and a major rail-link being constructed through the town. Climate [ edit ] 

Luton has a temperate marine climate , like much of the British Isles , with generally light precipitation throughout the year. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude . The average total annual rainfall is 698 mm (27.5 in) with rain falling on 117 days of the year. Snow accumulation over the Chiltern hills during October 2008 snowfall, Luton is denoted by the yellow dot. 

The local climate around Luton is differentiated somewhat from much of South East England due to its position in the Chiltern Hills , meaning it tends to be 1–2 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding towns – often flights at Luton airport , lying 160 m (525 ft) above sea level, will be suspended when marginal snow events occur, while airports at lower elevations, such as Heathrow , at 25 m (82 ft) above sea level, continue to function. An example of this is shown in the photograph to the right, the snowline being about 100 m (328 ft) above sea level . Absolute temperature extremes recorded at Rothamsted Research Station, 5 miles (8 km) south south east of Luton town centre and at a similar elevation range from −17.0 °C (1.4 °F) [49] in December 1981 and −16.7 °C (1.9 °F) in January 1963 [50] to 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) in August 2003 [51] and 33.8 °C (92.8 °F) in August 1990 [52] and July 2006.

The Victorian expansion of Luton focused on areas close to the existing town centre and railways. In the 1920s and 1930s growth typically was though absorbing neighbouring villages and hamlets(an example being Leagrave) and infill construction between them and Luton. After the Second World War there were several estates and developments constructed both by the local council such as Farley Hill or Marsh Farm, or privately such as Bushmead.

Luton has seen several waves of immigration. In the early part of the 20th century Irish and Scottish people arrived in the town – these were followed by Afro-Caribbean and Asian immigrants. More recently immigrants from other European Union countries have made Luton their home. As a result of this Luton has a diverse ethnic mix, with a significant population of Asian descent, mainly Pakistani 29,353 (14.4%), Indian 10,625 (5.2%) and Bangladeshi 13,606 (6.7%). [59] 

Since the 2011 census, Luton has become one of three white British -minority towns in the United Kingdom. It was announced in a report based on the census figures that along with Leicester and Slough , Luton was one of three towns outside London where the white British were now a minority, making up only 45% of Luton's population. However, the town still has a white majority when non-British whites such as the Irish and Eastern Europeans are included, [59] and 81% of the population of Luton still define themselves as British, despite the majority of its residents being from a foreign ethnic background. [60] Luton: Ethnicity : 2011 Census [59] Ethnic group Population % White 111,079 54.6 Mixed 8,281 4.1 Asian or Asian British 60,952 30.0 Black or Black British 19,909 9.8 Other Ethnic Group 2.980 1.5 Total 203,201 100 Religion [ edit ] The Methodist Chapel in High Town (built 1897) The Guru Nanak Gurdwara Sikh Temple, Luton

Luton has been identified in the media as a home of people with extremist social and religious viewpoints. The Muslim group Al-Muhajiroun was based there before it was banned, and the founder of the English Defence League is from Luton. A Muslim protest in March 2009 against soldiers returning from the Iraq War was followed by a counter-demonstration opposing sharia law in the United Kingdom. However, many residents say that the numbers of extremists, both Muslims and far-right, are small. [63] Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain lives in Luton, and a local representative of Churches Together described "the reality of life in the town" as "a healthy interaction between people of different faiths". [63] Economic activity [ edit ] 

Of the town's working population (classified 16–74 years of age by the Office for National Statistics ), 63% are employed. This figure includes students, the self-employed and those who are in part-time employment. 11% are retired, 8% look after the family or take care of the home and 5% are unemployed.

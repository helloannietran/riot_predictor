Provinces of India , earlier Presidencies of British India and still earlier, Presidency towns , were the administrative divisions of British governance in the subcontinent. Collectively, they were called British India . In one form or other they existed between 1612 and 1947, conventionally divided into three historical periods. During 1612–1757, the East India Company set up "factories" (trading posts) in several locations, mostly in coastal India, with the consent of the Mughal emperors or local rulers. Its rivals were the merchant trading companies of Holland and France. By the mid-18th century, three "Presidency towns": Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta had grown in size. During the period of Company rule in India , 1757–1858, the Company gradually acquired sovereignty over large parts of India, now called "Presidencies." However, it also increasingly came under British government oversight, in effect sharing sovereignty with the Crown. At the same time it gradually lost its mercantile privileges. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Company's remaining powers were transferred to the Crown. In the new British Raj (1858–1947), sovereignty extended to a few new regions, such as Upper Burma . Increasingly, however, unwieldy presidencies were broken up into "Provinces". [1]

British India [ edit ] Location of the Indian Empire (i. e. British India and the princely states ). 

In 1608, the English East India Company established a settlement at Surat (now in the state of Gujarat ), and this became the company's first headquarters town. It was followed in 1611 by a permanent factory at Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast , and in 1612 the company joined other already established European trading companies in Bengal . [2] However, following the decline of the Mughal Empire in 1707 by the hands of the Marathas and after the East India Company's victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and Battle of Buxar , both in Bengal 1764, the Company gradually began to formally expand its dominions and collectively call the area India . [3] By the mid-19th century, and after the three Anglo-Maratha Wars the East India Company had become the paramount political and military power in South Asia, its territory held in trust for the British Crown . [4] 

Company rule in Bengal , however, ended with the Government of India Act 1858 following the events of the Bengal Rebellion of 1857 . [4] From then known as British India, it was thereafter directly ruled by the British Crown as a colonial possession of the United Kingdom , and India was officially known after 1876 as the British Indian Empire . [5] India was divided into British India , regions that were directly administered by the British, with Acts established and passed in British Parliament, [6] and the Princely States , [7] that were ruled by local rulers of different ethnic backgrounds. These rulers were allowed a measure of internal autonomy in exchange for British suzerainty . British India constituted a significant portion of India both in area and population; in 1910, for example, it covered approximately 54% of the area and included over 77% of the population. [8] In addition, there were Portuguese and French exclaves in India. Independence from British rule was achieved in 1947 with the formation of two nations, the Dominions of India and Pakistan , the latter also including East Bengal , present-day Bangladesh . 

The term British India also applied to Burma for a shorter time period: starting in 1824, a small part of Burma, and by 1886, almost two thirds of Burma had come under British India . [6] This arrangement lasted until 1937, when Burma commenced being administered as a separate British colony. British India did not apply to other countries in the region, such as Sri Lanka (then Ceylon ), which was a British Crown colony , or the Maldive Islands , which were a British protectorate . At its greatest extent, in the early 20th-century, the territory of British India extended as far as the frontiers of Persia in the west; Afghanistan in the northwest; Tibet in the northeast; and China, French Indo-China and Siam in the east. It also included the Colony of Aden in the Arabian Peninsula . [9] The Four Grand Divisions of India [ edit ] 

The four governmental divisions in 1851 consisted of: Bengal Presidency with its capital at Calcutta Bombay Presidency with its capital at Bombay Madras Presidency with its capital at Madras North-Western Provinces with the seat of the Lieutenant-Governor at Agra . The original seat of government was at Allahabad , then at Agra from 1834 to 1868. In 1833, an Act of the British Parliament (statute 3 and 4, William IV, cap. 85) promulgated the elevation the Ceded and Conquered Provinces to the new Presidency of Agra , and the appointment of a new Governor for the latter, but the plan was never carried out. In 1835 another Act of Parliament (statute 5 and 6, William IV, cap. 52) renamed the region the North Western Provinces , this time to be administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, the first of whom, Sir Charles Metcalfe , would be appointed in 1836. [10] Presidency towns (1600–1765) [ edit ]

The presidency town of Bombay (shown here in a 1908 map) was established in 1684. 

The presidency town of Calcutta (shown here in a 1908 map) was established in 1690 as Fort William . Madras Presidency : established 1640. Bombay Presidency : East India Company's headquarters moved from Surat to Bombay (Mumbai) in 1687. Bengal Presidency : established 1690. 

The East India Company , which was incorporated on 31 December 1600, established trade relations with Indian rulers in Masulipatam on the east coast in 1611 and Surat on the west coast in 1612. [11] The company rented a trading outpost in Madras in 1639. [11] [11] Bombay, which was ceded to the British Crown by Portugal as part of the wedding dowry of Catherine of Braganza in 1661, was in turn granted to the East India Company to be held in trust for the Crown. [11] 

Meanwhile, in eastern India, after obtaining permission from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to trade with Bengal, the Company established its first factory at Hoogly in 1640. [11] Almost a half-century later, after Emperor Aurengzeb forced the Company out of Hooghly, Calcutta was founded by Job Charnock in 1686. [11] By the mid-18th century the three principal trading settlements, now called the Madras Presidency (or the Presidency of Fort St. George), the Bombay Presidency, and the Bengal Presidency (or the Presidency of Fort William) were each administered by a Governor.

Expansion of British Bengal and Burma. 

After Robert Clive 's victory in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the puppet government of a new Nawab of Bengal , was maintained by the East India Company. [13] However, after the invasion of Bengal by the Nawab of Oudh in 1764 and his subsequent defeat in the Battle of Buxar , the Company obtained the Diwani of Bengal, which included the right to administer and collect land-revenue (land tax) in Bengal , the region of present-day Bangladesh , West Bengal and Bihar . [13] In 1772, the Company also obtained the Nizāmat of Bengal (the "exercise of criminal jurisdiction") and thereby full sovereignty of the expanded Bengal Presidency . [13] During the period, 1773 to 1785, very little changed; the only exceptions were the addition of the dominions of the Raja of Banares to the western boundary of the Bengal Presidency, and the addition of Salsette Island to the Bombay Presidency . [14] 

Portions of the Kingdom of Mysore were annexed to the Madras Presidency after the Third Anglo-Mysore War ended in 1792. Next, in 1799, after the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War more of his territory was annexed to the Madras Presidency. [14] In 1801, Carnatic , which had been under the suzerainty of the Company, began to be directly administered by it as a part of the Madras Presidency. [15]

Provinces of India (1858–1947) [ edit ] Historical background [ edit ] 

The British Raj began with the idea of the Presidencies as the centres of government. Until 1834, when a General Legislative Council was formed, each Presidency under its Governor and Council was empowered to enact a code of so-called 'Regulations' for its government. Therefore, any territory or province that was added by conquest or treaty to a presidency came under the existing regulations of the corresponding presidency. However, in the case of provinces that were acquired but were not annexed to any of the three Presidencies, their official staff could be provided as the Governor-General pleased, and was not governed by the existing regulations of the Bengal, Madras, or Bombay Presidencies. Such provinces became known as 'Non-Regulation Provinces' and up to 1833 no provision for a legislative power existed in such places. [16] The same two kinds of management applied for districts. Thus Ganjam and Vizagapatam were non-regulation districts. [17] Non-Regulation Provinces included: Aden Settlement (1839–1932) Ajmir Province (Ajmer-Merwara) Cis-Sutlej states Saugor and Nerbudda Territories North-East Frontier (Assam) Cooch Behar South-West Frontier (Chota Nagpur) Jhansi Province Kumaon Province

At the turn of the 20th century, British India consisted of eight provinces that were administered either by a Governor or a Lieutenant-Governor. The following table lists their areas and populations (but does not include those of the dependent Native States): [18] During the partition of Bengal (1905–1912), a new Lieutenant-Governor's province of Eastern Bengal and Assam existed. In 1912, the partition was partially reversed, with the eastern and western halves of Bengal re-united and the province of Assam re-established; a new Lieutenant-Governor's province of Bihar and Orissa was also created.

In addition, there were a few minor provinces that were administered by a Chief Commissioner: [19] Minor Province [19] Area (in thousands of square miles) Population (in thousands of inhabitants) Chief Administrative Officer North-West Frontier Province 16 2,125 Chief Commissioner British Baluchistan 46 308 British Political Agent in Baluchistan served as ex officio Chief Commissioner Coorg 1.6 181 British Resident in Mysore served as ex officio Chief Commissioner Ajmer-Merwara 2.7 477 British Political Agent in Rajputana served as ex officio Chief Commissioner Andaman and Nicobar Islands 3 25 Chief Commissioner Provinces at independence, 1947 [ edit ] 

At the time of independence in 1947, British India had 17 provinces: Ajmer-Merwara Andaman and Nicobar Islands Assam Baluchistan Bengal Bihar Bombay Central Provinces and Berar Coorg Delhi Madras North-West Frontier Orissa Panth-Piploda Punjab Sind United Provinces 

Upon the Partition of British India into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan , 11 provinces (Ajmer-Merwara-Kekri, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bihar, Bombay, Central Provinces and Berar, Coorg, Delhi, Madras, Panth-Piploda, Orissa, and the United Provinces) joined India, 3 (Baluchistan, North-West Frontier and Sindh) joined Pakistan, and 3 ( Punjab , Bengal and Assam ) were partitioned between India and Pakistan. 

In 1950, after the new Indian Constitution was adopted, the provinces in India were replaced by redrawn states and union territories. Pakistan, however, retained its five provinces, one of which, East Bengal , was renamed East Pakistan in 1956 and became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971.

From the beginning of the 17th to the middle of the 18th century, the East India Company is a trading corporation, existing on the sufferance of the native powers, and in rivalry with the merchant companies of Holland and France. During the next century the Company acquires and consolidates its dominion, shares its sovereignty in increasing proportions with the Crown, and gradually loses its mercantile privileges and functions.

Goldsmiths, University of London is a public research university specialising in the arts, design, humanities, and social sciences. It is a constituent college within the University of London . It was founded in 1891 as Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in New Cross , London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed Goldsmiths' College . The word College was dropped from its branding in 2006, but "Goldsmiths' College", with the apostrophe , remains the institution's formal legal name. [3] 

Goldsmiths is also known [ by whom? ] for design, psychology, drama, sociology, music, politics, media and cultural studies, languages and literature, visual cultures, anthropology and educational studies. 

Nearly 20% of students come from outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.

History [ edit ] The Richard Hoggart Building 

In 1891, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths , one of the City of London Livery Companies , founded Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute (more commonly referred to simply as the "Goldsmiths' Institute" [4] ). The Goldsmiths' Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to "the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes". The original Institute was based in New Cross at the former Royal Naval School building. (This building, which was designed by the architect John Shaw Jr , is now known as the Richard Hoggart Building and remains the main building of the campus today.) Goldsmiths College students at the University of Nottingham in 1944 

In 1904, the Institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as Goldsmiths' College . (The apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word 'College' dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths' was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher's Certificate course. The College also ran its own Nursery School. 

Shortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield , at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the College to University College, Nottingham , a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an incendiary bomb and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947). 

During the 1960s Goldsmiths attracted a rapid expansion in its number of students. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and social science fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built during this period in order to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former Deptford Town Hall and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain Grade II listed building status. 

In 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the University of London and in 1990 received its Royal Charter . Among its wardens have been Richard Hoggart , Andrew Rutherford and Ben Pimlott . The current Warden is Pat Loughrey . [5] Campus and location [ edit ] Deptford Town Hall Building 

Goldsmiths is situated in New Cross , a highly populated area of south-east London with a considerable art and music scene. The area is well served by London Overground trains at New Cross and New Cross Gate . These former East London Line stations were integrated into the London Overground network in May 2010 with services northbound to Highbury and Islington; and southbound to Crystal Palace and West Croydon from New Cross Gate only. National Rail services still run from both New Cross and New Cross Gate stations to central London termini (i.e. London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross). 

The main building, the Richard Hoggart Building , was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect John Shaw, Jr (1803–1870). The former Deptford Townhall Building, designed by Henry Vaughan Lanchester and Edwin Alfred Rickards , acquired in 1998 and is now used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the RIBA award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the Ben Pimlott Building designed by Will Alsop and completed in 2005, and the New Academic Building which was completed in 2010. 

The library, or the Rutherford Building , has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. The third-floor library is believed to house the largest collection of audio-visual material in the UK. Goldsmiths' students, like all other students in the University of London , have full access to the collections at Senate House Library at Bloomsbury in central London. The Ben Pimlott Building 

The seven-storey Ben Pimlott Building on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive "scribble in the sky" (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths. It contains studio and teaching space for the Department of Art, as well as housing the Goldsmiths Digital Studios [6] and the Centre for Cognition, Computation and Culture. [7] 

The New Academic Building , situated next to the green, is now home to the Media and Communications department and the Institute for Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship (ICCE). [8] Facilities include a new 250-seat lecture theatre, seminar and teaching rooms, as well as a cafe with outdoor seating. Academic profile [ edit ] The Library Design [ edit ] 

The Department of Design's approach to design practice grew from a concern for ethical and environmentalist design. This developed alongside research by John Wood , and others, which informs their research into metadesign . TERU, the Technology Education Research Unit, has been instrumental in understanding how design technology works in schools, how to encourage learners towards creative interventions that improve the made world, and how to help teachers to support that process. The Writing Purposefully in Art and Design Network (Writing-PAD) has its main Centre at Goldsmiths. The Network now spans some 70 institutions across the art and design sector with 6 national and 2 International Writing PAD Centres. Cultural studies [ edit ] 

The Media and Communications Department, as well as the Centre for Cultural Studies, including Scott Lash , Angela McRobbie and Sara Ahmed . Anthropology [ edit ] 

The Department of Anthropology teaching staff include Keith Hart and David Graeber . The Goldsmiths Anthropology Department is also well known for its focus on visual anthropology. The realm of continental philosophy is represented with academics such as Saul Newman , Alberto Toscano and Jean Paul Martinon as well as Visiting Professors Andrew Benjamin and Bernard Stiegler . In the area of Psychology there is Chris French who specialises in the psychology of paranormal beliefs and experiences, cognition and emotion. [9] Saul Newman - notable for developing the concept of post-anarchism - is currently leading the department of politics. English Comparative Literature [ edit ] 

The English Comparative Literature Department is one of the university's largest and it covers English, comparative literature, American literature, creative writing and linguistics. Current academics include Bart Moore-Gilbert , Blake Morrison , Chris Baldick , Uttara Natarajan and Peter Dunwoodie. Its work in comparative literature developed after a merger with the Department of European Languages, later joined by its Creative Writing section. Music [ edit ] 

The Department of Music has a number of notable alumni, including Malcolm McLaren , Katy B , James Blake , Tunday Akintan, Rosie Lowe , and John Cale . The Research Centre for Russian Music , director Alexander Ivashkin , is internationally renowned for its archives devoted to Prokofiev and Schnittke, and unique collections including of music by Stravinsky, and Russian Piano Music first editions. [ citation needed ] Educational studies [ edit ] 

The Department of Educational Studies teaches undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses, and is home to a large programme of initial teacher education (primary and secondary), based on partnership arrangements with over 1500 schools and colleges. Rankings [ edit ] Rankings QS [10]

League tables based on the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise all place Goldsmiths within the top 35 research-intensive universities in the UK: 33rd in the Times Higher Education , 34th in The Guardian and 24th in The Independent . 

In the University guide 2011 by The Guardian , the Anthropology Department of Goldsmiths was ranked as 3rd in UK, following Oxford and Cambridge. [17] Goldsmiths Also stands 7th in the University guide 2014 league table for Art and Design by The Guardian . [18] The Complete University Guide has placed Goldsmiths, University of London in the UK’s top 10 universities in two subject areas in 2014. The Department of Art and the Department of Design came in the top 10 of the Art Design subject table, [19] and the Department of Media and Communications came in the top 10 in the Communication Media Studies table. [20] 

In April 2015 Goldsmiths' media and communications department was named the second best in the UK and twenty-second world-wide. [21] Student life [ edit ] Sports, clubs and traditions [ edit ] 

Sports teams and societies are organised by the Goldsmiths Students' Union. The Union runs 18 sports clubs, 11 of which compete in either University of London Union or BUCS leagues. In May 2011 Goldsmiths won the Arts Varsity Challenge Cup against University of the Arts London (UAL), for the third year running. 

The Students' Union runs 35 societies, ranging from political societies and identity-based societies (for example the Jewish society and the LGBT society) to interest-based societies (the Film Society and the on-campus radio station Wired are the two largest Societies) and more. 

In 2015 the university's Islamic Society received press attention for disrupting a speech by ex-Muslim Maryam Namazie organised by the university's Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society. [22] [23] [24] Student media [ edit ] 

Goldsmiths has a long history of student-led media platforms. Smiths Magazine ([smiths] [25] ), The Leopard newspaper, [26] and Wired Radio (Wired [27] ). The student media is run independently by students at the college. Student housing [ edit ] 

The university owns 7 halls of residence which offer accommodation for students: Batavia Mews Chesterman House Dean House Loring Hall Surrey House Surrey House Annexe Raymont Hall 

Several of the halls include electricity bills and gas bills as part of rent. Free internet is also offered in some of the halls. Visiting international students are generally assigned accommodation in Loring Hall, Dean House or Chesterman House. Loring Hall currently holds around 400 students. Students' Union [ edit ] Main article: Goldsmiths Students' Union 

The union provides, among other things, catering facilities, a chaplaincy , a medical clinic , an advice service on academic and welfare issues and a state of the art gym for students' use. [28] 

In October 2014, the union faced critical coverage, from student newspaper The Tab after voting down a proposal to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day , with Education Officer Sarah El-alfy describing it as "Eurocentric" and "colonialist." [29] [30] El-alfy offered to help put forward a redrafted version of the motion for the following Student Assembly meeting. The Union issued a statement claiming "Redrafting motions and re-entering them at a later date isn’t unusual in Students’ Unions and shouldn’t be misinterpreted as opposition." [31] [32] 

In 2015 the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer, Bahar Mustafa , caused a public controversy by banning white people and men from a student union event. [33] [34] Bahar Mustafa caused more public controversy through her justification of the ban, [35] [36] and through her use of the hash tag #KillAllWhiteMen. A group of students petitioned for a vote of no confidence in her, but the petition was signed by less than 3% of the student body and therefore failed to trigger a referendum.

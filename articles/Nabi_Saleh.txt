The Gloria Jean’s Coffees story began in 1979 in a small town just north of Chicago, USA where the company’s namesake, Gloria Jean Kvetko and her husband Ed saw the opportunity to offer specialty gourmet coffees in a warm and friendly atmosphere. With appreciation for quality coffee growing, the concept became a success and Gloria Jean’s Coffees outlets opened around the USA. 

In 1993 Gloria Jean and Ed sold the franchise for an estimated US$40 million and the company began its expansion offshore – a journey that would later take a remarkable turn to make the company an Australian success story. 

In 1995, Nabi Saleh, an Australian businessman internationally regarded for his coffee knowledge and expertise, visited the USA to experience the Gloria Jean’s Coffees brand first hand. Nabi and his business partner Peter Irvine subsequently bought the Master Franchise for Australia and the first Australian Gloria Jean’s Coffees store was opened in Miranda, Sydney in 1996. 

By 2004 Gloria Jean’s Coffees had opened more than 200 coffee houses across Australia and became a national brand with coffee houses present in every Australian state and territory. With success accomplished at home, Nabi and Peter set their sights on achieving their vision to make Gloria Jean’s Coffees the most loved and respected coffee house in the world. 

At the end of 2004, Nabi and Peter had purchased the international branding and roasting rights for all countries outside of the U.S. making Gloria Jean’s Coffees an Australian owned global brand overnight. 

Four years later, the story has come full circle. In early 2009 Gloria Jean’s Coffees International affiliate company, Praise International North America Inc, completed negotiations to buy Gloria Jean’s Coffees U.S. retail and franchise operations, consisting of 102 coffee houses in 24 states, from its current U.S. owner.

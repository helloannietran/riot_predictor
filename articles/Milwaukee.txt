Milwaukee ( / m ɪ l ˈ w ɔː k iː / , / ˈ m w ɔː k i / ) is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin and the fifth-largest city in the Midwestern United States . The county seat of Milwaukee County , it is on Lake Michigan 's western shore. According to the 2010 census, Milwaukee has a population of 594,833. Milwaukee is the main cultural and economic center of the Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Metropolitan Area with a population of 2,043,904 as of an official 2014 estimate . [ citation needed ] 

The first Europeans to pass through the area were French Catholic missionaries and fur traders . In 1818, the French Canadian explorer Solomon Juneau settled in the area, and in 1846 Juneau's town combined with two neighboring towns to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee. Large numbers of German immigrants helped increase the city's population during the 1840s, with Poles and other immigrants arriving in the following decades. 

Known for its brewing traditions, major new additions to the city include the Milwaukee Riverwalk , the Wisconsin Center , Miller Park , an expansion to the Milwaukee Art Museum , Milwaukee Repertory Theater , and Pier Wisconsin , as well as major renovations to the UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena and the planned Milwaukee Bucks Arena , scheduled to open in 2018. In addition, many new skyscrapers, condos, lofts and apartments have been built in neighborhoods on and near the lakefront and riverbanks.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Milwaukee American Indian Milwaukee [ edit ] 

The first recorded inhabitants of the Milwaukee area are the Menominee , Fox , Mascouten , Sauk , Potawatomi , Ojibwe (all Algic/Algonquian peoples) and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) (a Siouan people) Native American tribes. Many of these people had lived around Green Bay [6] before migrating to the Milwaukee area around the time of European contact. 

In the second half of the 18th century, the Indians at Milwaukee played a role in all the major wars on the American continent. During the French and Indian War , a group of "Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu at the Battle of the Monongahela . [7] In the American Revolutionary War , the Indians around Milwaukee were some of the few Indians who remained loyal to the American cause throughout the Revolution. [8] 

After American independence, the Indians fought the United States in the Northwest Indian War as part of the Council of Three Fires . During the War of 1812 , Indians held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack Chicago . [9] This resulted in the Battle of Fort Dearborn on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. The War of 1812 did not end well for the Indians, and after the Black Hawk War in 1832, the Indians in Milwaukee signed their final treaty with the United States in Chicago in 1833. This paved the way for American settlement. Milwaukee since European settlement [ edit ] Statue of Solomon Juneau , who helped establish the city of Milwaukee 

Europeans had arrived in the Milwaukee area prior to the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; therefore, he is the first European descent resident of the Milwaukee region. [10] The word "Milwaukee" may come from the Potawatomi language minwaking , or Ojibwe language ominowakiing , "Gathering place [by the water]". [11] [12] Early explorers called the Milwaukee River and surrounding lands various names: Melleorki, Milwacky, Mahn-a-waukie, Milwarck, and Milwaucki. For many years, printed records gave the name as "Milwaukie". One story of Milwaukee's name says, 

[O]ne day during the thirties of the last century [1800s] a newspaper calmly changed the name to Milwaukee, and Milwaukee it has remained until this day. [11] 

The spelling "Milwaukie" lives on in Milwaukie , Oregon , named after the Wisconsin city in 1847, before the current spelling was universally accepted. 

Milwaukee has three " founding fathers ": Solomon Juneau , Byron Kilbourn , and George H. Walker . Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He was not the first European settler (Alexis Laframboise settled a trading post in 1785 [10] ) but founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the Milwaukee River , and made sure the streets running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today. Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent builder was George H. Walker . He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point. 

The first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835. Early that year it became known Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites and by the years' end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern States. On Sept. 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee and the whole number of votes cast was thirty-nine. [13] 

By 1840, the three towns had grown quite a bit, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the Milwaukee Bridge War of 1845. Following the Bridge War, it was decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor. [14] Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872 

Milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly German , made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify German immigration to the United States in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from Southwestern Germany , the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily Northwestern Germany , while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from Northeastern Germany . [15] In the 1840s, the number of people who left German-speaking lands was 385,434, in the 1850s it reached 976,072, and an all-time high of 1.4 million emigrated in the 1880s. In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest. [15] 

By 1900 34 percent of Milwaukee's population was of German background. [15] The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from Prussia , followed by Bavaria , Saxony , Hanover , and Hesse-Darmstadt . Milwaukee gained its reputation for the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but the sense of community which the immigrants established there. [16] 

Most German immigrants came to Wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland. [16] However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in Europe. [17] After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the "Forty-Eighters," turned their attention to the United States. One of the most famous "liberal revolutionaries" of 1848 was Carl Schurz , who explained why he came to Milwaukee in 1854, "It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters [sic] had congregated. But so far as I know, nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'German Athens of America' as Milwaukee was called at the time." [18] 

Schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies Germans developed in Milwaukee. The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in German language organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also made a lasting impact on the American school system. Kindergarten was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the American Turners . Specifically in Milwaukee, the American Turners established its own Normal College for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy. [19] 

Milwaukee's German element is still strongly present today. The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July and an Oktoberfest in October. Milwaukee boasts a number of German restaurants, as well as a traditional German beer hall. Even the German language is not lost, as a German language immersion school is offered for children in grades K-5 . [20] Germans were, and still are, an important component of life in Wisconsin and Milwaukee. Milwaukee's Lake Front Depot in 1898 

Although the German presence in Milwaukee after the Civil War remained strong, other groups made their way to the city. Foremost among these were Polish immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest Polish settlements in the USA . Wisconsin Street, Milwaukee, 1900 

For many residents, Milwaukee's South Side is synonymous with the Polish community which settled here. The group's proud ethnicity maintained a high profile here for decades and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the families began to disperse to the southern suburbs. 

By 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in Milwaukee County and the US Census shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community. 

St. Stanislaus Catholic Church and the surrounding neighborhood was the center of Polish life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the "Polish Grand Avenue". As Mitchell Street grew denser, the Polish population started moving south to the Lincoln Village neighborhood , home to the Basilica of St. Josaphat and Kosciuszko Park . Other Polish communities started on the east side of Milwaukee and Jones Island , a major commercial fishing center settled mostly by Poles from the Baltic Sea . 

Milwaukee has the fifth-largest Polish population in the U.S. at 45,467, ranking behind New York City (211,203), Chicago (165,784), Los Angeles (60,316) and Philadelphia (52,648). [21] The city holds Polish Fest , an annual celebration of Polish culture and cuisine . 

In addition to the Germans and Poles, Milwaukee received a large influx of other European immigrants from Lithuania , Italy , Ireland , France , Russia , Bohemia and Sweden , which included Jews , Lutherans , and Catholics . Italian Americans number in the city at 16,992 but, in Milwaukee County they number at 38,286. [21] The largest Italian American festival, Festa Italiana is held in the city. [22] By 1910, Milwaukee shared the distinction with New York City of having the largest percentage of foreign-born residents in the United States. [23] In 1910, whites represented 99.7% of the city's total population of 373 857. [24] Milwaukee has a strong Greek Orthodox Community, many of whom attend the Greek Orthodox Church on Milwaukee's northwest side, designed by Wisconsin -born architect Frank Lloyd Wright . Milwaukee has a sizable Croatian population with Croatian churches and their own historic and successful soccer club The Croatian Eagles at the 30-acre Croatian Park in Franklin, Wisconsin. 

Milwaukee also has a large Serbian population with Serbian restaurants, a Serbian K-8 School , Serbian churches along with an American Serb Hall. The American Serb Hall in Milwaukee is known for its Friday fish fries and popular events. Many U.S. presidents have visited Milwaukee's Serb Hall in the past. The Bosnian population is growing in Milwaukee as well due to the recent migration after the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina . 

During this time, a small community of African Americans who emigrated from the South formed a community that would come to be known as Bronzeville . As industry boomed, the African-American influence grew in Milwaukee. 

By 1925, around 9,000 Mexican Americans lived in Milwaukee, but the Great Depression forced many of them to move back home. In the 1950s, the Hispanic community was beginning to emerge. They arrived for jobs, filling positions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. During this time there were labor shortages due to the immigration laws that restricted Europeans from immigrating to the United States. Additionally, strikes contributed to the labor shortages. [25] 

During the first sixty years of the 20th century, Milwaukee was the major city in which the Socialist Party of America earned the highest votes. Milwaukee elected three mayors who ran on the ticket of the Socialist Party: Emil Seidel (1910–1912), Daniel Hoan (1916–1940), and Frank Zeidler (1948–1960). Often referred to as " Sewer Socialists ", the Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor. 

In 2012, Milwaukee was listed as a gamma global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . [26] Historic neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Milwaukee The historic Third Ward 

In 1892, Whitefish Bay , South Milwaukee , and Wauwatosa were incorporated. They were followed by Cudahy (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as Shorewood , in 1900. In the early 20th century West Allis (1902), and West Milwaukee (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of "inner-ring" suburbs. 

In the 1920s Chicago gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the Prohibition era . Al Capone , noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb Brookfield , where moonshine was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone. [27] 

By 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the United States. Its population peaked at 741,324. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 8.4% black and 91.1% white. [28] 

By the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline due to white flight [29] Milwaukee had a population of 636,212 by 1980, while the population of the metropolitan area increased. Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of its fellow " rust belt " cities due to its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods. 

Since the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods , and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the Historic Third Ward , Lincoln Village , the East Side , and more recently Walker's Point and Bay View , along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area. These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and has stabilized many parts of Milwaukee. 

Milwaukee's European history is evident today. Largely through its efforts to preserve its history, in 2006 Milwaukee was named one of the "Dozen Distinctive Destinations" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation . [30] 

In 2010, the Census Bureau released revised population numbers for Milwaukee that showed the city gained population, growing by 1.3%, between 2000 and 2009. This was the first population increase the city of Milwaukee has seen since the 1960 census .

Milwaukee lies along the shores and bluffs of Lake Michigan at the confluence of three rivers: the Menomonee , the Kinnickinnic , and the Milwaukee . Smaller rivers, such as the Root River and Lincoln Creek, also flow through the city. 

Milwaukee's terrain is sculpted by the glacier path and includes steep bluffs along Lake Michigan that begin about a mile (1.6 km) north of downtown. In addition, 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Milwaukee is the Kettle Moraine and lake country that provides an industrial landscape combined with inland lakes. 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 96.80 square miles (250.71 km 2 ), of which, 96.12 square miles (248.95 km 2 ) is land and 0.68 square miles (1.76 km 2 ) is water. [1] The city is overwhelmingly (99.89% of its area) in Milwaukee County , but there are two tiny unpopulated parts of it that extend into neighboring counties. The part in Washington County is bordered by the southeast corner of Germantown , while the part in Waukesha County is bordered by the southeast corner of Menomonee Falls , north of the village of Butler .

North-south streets are numbered, and east-west streets are named. However, north-south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east-west streets. The north-south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east-west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by Mequon in Ozaukee County , and by some Waukesha County communities. 

Milwaukee is crossed by Interstate 43 and Interstate 94 , which come together downtown at the Marquette Interchange . The Interstate 894 bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains Interstate 41 ) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and Interstate 794 comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the Hoan Bridge , then ends near the Bay View neighborhood and becomes the "Lake Parkway" ( WIS-794 ). 

One of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called Polish flats . These are two- family homes with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced rental apartment unit. Since Polish-American immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them. 

The tallest building in the city is the U.S. Bank Center . Climate [ edit ] 

Milwaukee's location in the Great Lakes Region often has rapidly changing weather, producing a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is 71.8 °F (22.1 °C), while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of 22.3 °F (−5.4 °C). Of the 50 largest cities in the United States, [31] Milwaukee has the second-coldest average annual temperature, after Minneapolis-St. Paul . [32] [ not in citation given ] 

Because of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called "lake breeze" - a smaller scale version of the more common sea breeze . The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually 5 to 15 miles (8 to 24 km), with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Residents refer to this phenomenon with the phrase "cooler near the lake". Because Milwaukee's official climate site, General Mitchell International Airport , is only 3 miles (4.8 km) from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the Milwaukee metropolitan area . 

As the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds 15 mph (24 km/h). The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months. 

Aside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the urban heat island effect . Onshore winds elevate daytime relative humidity levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby. 

Thunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing hail and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a tornado . However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the precipitation. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but even during meteorological winter, on average, over 40% of days see less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) on the ground. [33] 

Milwaukee tends to experience highs that are 90 °F (32 °C) on or above 7 days per year, and lows at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on 6–7 nights. [33] Extremes range from 105 °F (41 °C) set on July 24, 1934 down to −26 °F (−32 °C) on both January 17, 1982 and February 4, 1996. [34] The 1982 event, also known as Cold Sunday , featured temperatures as low as −40 °F (−40 °C) in some of the suburbs as little as 10 miles (16 km) to the north of Milwaukee.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large algae blooms , which can threaten marine life. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city became an "Innovating City" in the Global Compact Cities Program. The Milwaukee Water Council was also formed in 2009. [36] Its objectives were to "better understand the processes related to freshwater systems dynamics" and to develop "a policy and management program aimed at balancing the protection and utilization of freshwater". The strategy used the Circles of Sustainability method. Instead of treating the water quality problem as a single environmental issue, the Water Council draws on the Circles method to analyze the interconnection among ecological, economic, political and cultural factors. [37] This holistic water treatment helped Milwaukee win the US Water Alliance's 2012 US Water Prize.

In 2000, the Census estimated at least 1,408 same-sex households in Milwaukee, or about 0.6% of all households in the city. [41] Gay-friendly communities have developed primarily in Walker's Point , but also in Bay View , Historic Third Ward , Washington Heights , Riverwest , and the East Side . In 2001, Milwaukee was named the #1 city for lesbians by Girlfriends magazine. [42] 

The city's population is spread out with 28.6% under the age of 18, 12.2% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 18.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 31 years. For every 100 females there are 91.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 87.2 males. The 2000 census found Milwaukee had the most racially segregated residential areas of any major U.S. city. 

The median income for a household in the city is $32,216, and the median income for a family is $37,879. Males have a median income of $32,244 versus $26,013 for females. The per capita income for the city is $16,181. 21.3% of the population and 17.4% of families are below the poverty line . Despite the high poverty rates, in 2010, home renters of Milwaukee faced an increasing rate for rent, up 3%. [43] Out of the total population, 31.6% of those under the age of 18 and 11.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. 

According to the 2010 Census, 44.8% of the population was White (37.0% non-Hispanic white ), 40.0% was Black or African American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.5% Asian, 3.4% from two or more races. 17.3% of Milwaukee's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race) (11.7% Mexican, 4.1% Puerto Rican). [44] 

Milwaukee is the 31st most populous city in the United States , and anchors the 39th most populous Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States. Its combined statistical area population makes it the 29th most populous Combined Statistical Area of the United States. In 2012, Milwaukee was listed as a gamma global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . 

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 38.3% of Milwaukee's residents reported having African American ancestry and 20.8% reported German ancestry. Other significant population groups include Polish (8.8%), Irish (6.5%), Italian (3.6%), English (2.8%), and French (1.7%). According to the 2010 United States Census, the largest Hispanic backgrounds in Milwaukee as of 2010 were: Mexican (69,680), Puerto Rican (24,672), Other Hispanic or Latino (3,808), Central American (1,962), South American (1,299), Cuban (866) and Dominican (720). [45] 

The Milwaukee metropolitan area was cited as being the most segregated in the U.S. in a Jet Magazine article in 2002. [46] The source of this information was a segregation index developed in the mid-1950s and used since 1964. In 2003, a non-peer reviewed study was conducted by hired researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee which claimed Milwaukee is not "hypersegregated" and instead ranks as the 43rd most integrated city in America. [47] In 2011, according to an article by Daniel Denvir at www.salon.org, John Paul Dewitt of censusscope.org and the University of Michigan's Social Science Data Analysis Network looks at census data and finds Milwaukee to be the most segregated urban area in the US. [48] Through continued dialogue between Milwaukee's citizens, the city is trying to reduce racial tensions and the rate of segregation. [49] With demographic changes in the wake of white flight , segregation in metropolitan Milwaukee is primarily in the suburbs rather than the city as in the era of Father Groppi . [50] [51] 

In 2015 Milwaukee was rated as the "worst city for black Americans" based on disparities in employment and income levels. [52] The city's black population experiences disproportionately high levels of incarceration and a severe educational achievement gap . [53] Ethnic groups [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . (March 2014) See also: Hmong in Wisconsin 

In 2013 Mark Pfeifer, the editor of the Hmong Studies Journal , stated Hmong in Milwaukee had recently been moving to the northwest side of Milwaukee; they historically lived in the north and south areas of Milwaukee. [54] The Hmong American Peace Academy / International Peace Academy , a K-12 school system in Milwaukee centered on the Hmong community, opened in 2004. [54] Religion [ edit ] St. Josaphat Basilica , in Milwaukee's historic Lincoln Village .

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee and the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee are headquartered in Milwaukee. The School Sisters of the Third Order of St Francis have their mother house in Milwaukee, and several other religious orders have a significant presence in the area, including the Jesuits and Franciscans . Milwaukee, where Father Josef Kentenich was exiled for 14 years from 1952 to 1965, is also the center for the Schoenstatt Movement in the United States. St. Joan of Arc Chapel , the oldest church in Milwaukee, is on the Marquette University campus. St. Josaphat Basilica was the first church to be given the Basilica honor in Wisconsin and the third in the United States. Holy Hill National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians , northwest of Milwaukee, in Hubertus, Wisconsin , was also made a Basilica in 2006. 

Milwaukee is home for several Lutheran Church Synods, including The Greater Milwaukee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ; the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS), which operates Concordia University in Mequon and Milwaukee Lutheran High School , the nation's oldest Lutheran high school; and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), which was founded in 1850 in Milwaukee and maintains its national headquarters there. 

The St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is a landmark of the Serbian community in Milwaukee, located by the American Serb hall. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the Milwaukee area. The Milwaukee area has two stakes, with fourteen wards and four branches among them. The closest temple is the Chicago Illinois Temple . The area is part of the Wisconsin Milwaukee Mission . [56] Economy [ edit ] Early economy [ edit ] 

Milwaukee's founding fathers had a vision for the city: they knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat -growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor . Improvements in railways at the time made this possible. 

There was intense competition for markets with Chicago , and to a lesser degree, with Racine and Kenosha . Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest. [57] Rail tracks along the industrial Menomonee Valley , ancestral home of the Menominee Indians 

Because of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's Menomonee Valley has historically been home to manufacturing , stockyards , rendering plants , shipping , and other heavy industry . 

Reshaping of the valley began with the railroads built by city co-founder Byron Kilbourn to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of wheat on the planet, and related industry developed. Grain elevators were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant German immigrant population , breweries sprang up around the processing of barley and hops . A number of tanneries were constructed, of which the Pfister Vogel tannery grew to become the largest in America. 

In 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a brickyard near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname "Cream City", and consequently the brick was called Cream City brick . By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world. 

Flour mills , packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the marshlands drained and the Kinnickinnic and Milwaukee Rivers dredged, attention turned to the valley. 

Along with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the Milwaukee Road , Falk Corporation , Cutler-Hammer , Harnischfeger Corporation , Chain Belt Company , Nordberg Manufacturing Company and other industry giants. 

Early in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer brass era automobile makers, including Ogren (from 1919 to 1922). [58] Brewing [ edit ] 

Milwaukee became synonymous with Germans and beer beginning in the 1850s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them German-owned and -operated. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian James Buck recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents. Today, beer halls and taverns are abundant in the city, but only one of the major breweries— Miller —remains in Milwaukee. [57] Entrance to Miller Brewery in Milwaukee The Pabst Brewery Complex , closed in 1997, before its redevelopment 

Milwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest beer breweries ( Schlitz , Blatz , Pabst , and Miller ), and was the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the world's leading beer producer after the loss of two of those breweries, Miller Brewing Company remains a key employer by employing over 2,200 of the city's workers. [59] Because of Miller's position as the second-largest beer-maker in the U.S., the city remains known as a beer town. The city and surrounding areas are seeing a resurgence in microbreweries, nanobreweries and brewpubs with the craft beer movement. [ citation needed ] 

The historic Milwaukee Brewery in "Miller Valley" at 4000 West State Street, is the oldest functioning major brewery in the United States. In July 2008, it was announced Coors beer would be added to the list of beers brewed in Miller Valley. This created additional brewery jobs in Milwaukee, but the company's world headquarters moved from Milwaukee to Chicago . 

In addition to Miller and the heavily automated Leinenkugel's brewery in the old Blatz 10th Street plant, other stand-alone breweries in Milwaukee include Milwaukee Brewing Company, a microbrewery in Walker's Point neighborhood ; Lakefront Brewery , a microbrewery in Brewers Hill; Sprecher Brewery, a German brewery that also brews craft sodas; Enlightened Brewing Company, a nanobrewery in Walker's Point; and Brenner Brewing, also in Walker's Point. 

Three beer brewers with Wisconsin operations made the 2009 list of the 50 largest beermakers in the United States, based on beer sales volume. Making the latest big-breweries list from Wisconsin is MillerCoors at No. 2. MillerCoors is a joint venture formed in 2008 by Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Golden, Colorado-based Molson Coors Brewing Company . The Minhas Craft Brewery in Monroe, Wisconsin , which brews Huber, Rhinelander and Mountain Crest brands, ranked No. 14 and New Glarus Brewing Company , New Glarus, Wisconsin , whose brands include Spotted Cow, Fat Squirrel and Uff-da, ranked No. 32. [60] 

Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley , two sitcoms that aired on ABC in the 1970s and 1980s, were set in Milwaukee, and often used the Milwaukee breweries as a backdrop for the storyline. Milwaukee's economy today [ edit ] 

In 2007, three Milwaukee-area companies were among nine firms honored for manufacturing excellence in the Wisconsin Manufacturer of the Year competition. Astronautics Corporation of America and Brady Corporation , both of which have headquarters in Milwaukee, and Wisconsin Plating Works Inc., Racine, each received special awards. Privately held Astronautics, a major supplier of government and commercial avionics, was honored for its high-technology research and development program. Brady, a publicly owned manufacturer of signs, labels and other identification and security products, received an award for corporate excellence. Privately owned Wisconsin Plating Works, which provides metal finishing services, received an award for employee and environmental stewardship. Nominated companies were evaluated in areas such as financial growth or consistency, technological advances, product development, environmental solutions, operational excellence/continuous improvement, commitment to employees, and effective research and development.

Two Milwaukee companies ranked second in their field: Manpower Inc. in the temporary help industry and Northwestern Mutual in life and health insurance. Johnson Controls Inc., Glendale, placed fourth among motor-vehicle parts firms. Ranked fifth were Fiserv Inc., Brookfield, in financial data services and Kohl's Corp., Menomonee Falls, among general merchandisers.

Music [ edit ] Main article: Music of Milwaukee Aerial view of "Jazz in the Park," Cathedral Square Park 

Milwaukee has a long history of musical activity. The first organized musical society, called "Milwaukee Beethoven Society" formed in 1843, three years before the city was incorporated. [80] 

The large concentrations of German and other European immigrants contributed to the musical character of the city. Saengerfesten were held regularly. [81] 

In the early 20th century guitar legend Les Paul , and pianist Liberace were some of the area's most famous musicians. Both Paul, born in Waukesha, and Liberace, born in West Allis, launched their internationally recognized careers in Milwaukee music venues. Paramount Records , primarily a jazz and blues record label, was founded in Grafton , a northern suburb of Milwaukee, in the 1920s and 1930s. Hal Leonard Corporation , founded in 1947 is one of the world's largest music print publishers, and is headquartered in Milwaukee. The Hal Leonard Guitar Method was launched in Milwaukee becoming one of the first methods to incorporate popular music. The course today remains the leading guitar method in the world; it has taught millions of people how to play. Today, Hal Leonard represents in print some of the world's best known and most respected artists, such as: Aerosmith, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Billy Joel, Elton John, B.B. King, Nirvana, Tom Petty, Pink Floyd, The Police, Elvis Presley, Queen, Bonnie Raitt, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frank Sinatra, Sting, U2, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Who, Hank Williams, Stevie Wonder, and others. [82] More recently, Milwaukee has enjoyed a vibrant history of rock , hip hop , jazz , soul , blues , punk , ska , industrial music , electronica , world music , and pop music bands. 

Milwaukee's most famous music venue is Summerfest . Summerfest claims to be the world's largest music festival and was founded in Milwaukee in 1968. Live musical acts are offered on 11 stages, for 11 days beginning in late June. On the Summerfest grounds, the largest theater in the city is the Marcus Amphitheater with a 23,000 person capacity. 

Venues such as Pabst Theater , Marcus Center for Performing Arts, the Helene Zelazo Center for the Performing Arts , Marcus Amphitheater ( Summerfest Grounds ), Riverside Theater , the Northern Lights Theater , and The Rave frequently bring internationally known acts to Milwaukee. 'Jazz in the Park', a weekly jazz show held at downtown Cathedral Square Park , has become a summer tradition; free, public performances with a picnic environment. [83] Nearby Pere Marquette Park hosts "River Rhythms" on Wednesday nights.

Through its Milwaukee Wireless Initiative, the city has contracted with Midwest Fiber Networks to invest US$20 million in setting up a municipal wireless network city-wide. Under the plan, the city will designate numerous government and public service websites for free access, and city residents will be able to access unlimited content for a monthly fee. Full wireless coverage was expected by March 2008, [84] but delays have been reported. [85] 

The city had previously established free wireless networks in two downtown city parks: Cathedral Square ; and Pere Marquette Park . [86] [87] [88] Sports [ edit ] Main article: Sports in Milwaukee Miller Park , home of the Brewers The BMO Harris Bradley Center

Though the city currently has no NFL team (it supported the Milwaukee Badgers in the 1920s), Milwaukee is considered a home market for the Green Bay Packers . [91] The team split its home schedule between Green Bay and Milwaukee from 1933 to 1994, with the majority of the Milwaukee games being played at County Stadium . [92] Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee games continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the "Gold Package" plan. [93] The Packers' longtime flagship station is Milwaukee-based WTMJ AM 620 . [94] 

Milwaukee has a rich history of involvement in professional and nonprofessional sports, since the 19th century. Abraham Lincoln watched cricket in Milwaukee in 1849 when he attended a game between Chicago and Milwaukee. In 1854, the Milwaukee Cricket Club had 150 members. [95] 

Milwaukee was also the host city of the International Cycling Classic , which included the men's and women's Superweek Pro Tour races, featuring top professional and elite amateur cyclists and teams from across the U.S. and more than 20 foreign countries. Parks and recreation [ edit ] Main article: Parks of Milwaukee Panoramic view of Lake Park , c. 1890.

Milwaukee County is known for its well-developed Parks of Milwaukee park system. [96] The "Grand Necklace of Parks", designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , designer of New York's Central Park, includes Lake Park , River Park (now Riverside Park), and West Park (now Washington Park). Milwaukee County Parks offer facilities for sunbathing, picnics, grilling, disc golf , and ice skating. [97] Milwaukee has over 140 parks with over 15,000 acres (6,100 ha) of parks and parkways. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land , a national land conservation organization, reported Milwaukee had the 19th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. [98] Parks and nature centers [ edit ] 

The Monarch Trail, on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, is a 1.25-mile (2 km) trail that highlights the fall migration of the Monarch butterflies . [99] 

During the summer months, Cathedral Park in Downtown Milwaukee hosts "Jazz in the Park" on Thursday nights. [100] Nearby Pere Marquette Park hosts "River Rhythms" on Wednesday nights. Milwaukee County public markets [ edit ] The Milwaukee Public Market

Government and politics [ edit ] Main article: Government of Milwaukee 

Milwaukee has a mayor-council form of government. With the election of Mayor John O. Norquist in 1988, the city adopted a cabinet form of government with the mayor appointing those department heads not otherwise elected or appointed—notably the Fire and Police Chiefs. While this gave the mayor greater control of the day-to-day operations of the city, the Common Council retains almost complete control over the city's finances and the mayor, with the exception of his proposed annual budget, cannot directly introduce legislation. The Common Council consists of 15 members, one from each district in the city. Milwaukee has a history of giving long tenures to its mayors; from Frank Zeidler to current mayor Tom Barrett , the city has had only four mayors in the last 60 years. When 28-year incumbent Henry Maier retired in 1988, he held the record for longest term of service for a city of Milwaukee's size. 

Milwaukee has been a Democratic stronghold for more than a century at the federal level. At the local level, Socialists frequently won the mayorship and (for briefer periods) other city and county offices during much of the first sixty years of the 20th century. The city is split between four state Senate districts, each of which is composed of three Assembly districts. All but four state legislators representing the city are Democrats; the four Republicans —two in the State Assembly and two in the State Senate —represent outer portions of the city that are part of districts dominated by heavily Republican suburban counties. In 2008, Barack Obama won Milwaukee with 77% of the vote. [101] 

Milwaukee makes up the overwhelming majority of Wisconsin's 4th congressional district . The district is heavily Democratic. The Democratic primary for the seat is considered more important than the general election. [102] The district is currently represented by Democrat Gwen Moore . A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Milwaukee in Congress since Charles J. Kersten lost his seat in the 5th district in 1954 to Democrat Henry S. Reuss . 

Tim Carpenter (D), Lena Taylor (D), Leah Vukmir (R), Nikiya Harris (D), Chris Larson (D), Alberta Darling (R), and Mary Lazich (R) represent Milwaukee in the Wisconsin State Senate , and Daniel Riemer (D), JoCasta Zamarripa (D), Josh Zepnick (D), David Bowen (D), Mandela Barnes (D), Frederick P. Kessler (D), Rob Hutton (R), Dale P. Kooyenga (R), Leon Young (D), La Tonya Johnson (D), Evan Goyke (D), Jonathan Brostoff (D), Christine Sinicki (D), Janel Brandtjen (R), and Mike Kuglitsch (R) represent Milwaukee in the Wisconsin State Assembly . 

In addition to the election of a Mayor and Common Council on the city level, Milwaukee residents elect county representatives to the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors , as well as a Milwaukee County Executive. The current County Executive is Chris Abele . 

A Mexican Consulate is also located in Milwaukee that serves a total of 65 counties in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . [103] Crime [ edit ] 

For several years, Milwaukee ranked among the ten most dangerous large cities in the United States. [104] [105] Despite its improvement since then, Milwaukee still fares worse when comparing specific crime types to the national average (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery); only aggravated assaults occur less frequently in Milwaukee than the national average. [106] [107] The Milwaukee Police Department 's Gang Unit was reactivated in 2004 after Nannette Hegerty was sworn in as chief. In 2006 alone, some 4,000 charges were brought against suspects through Milwaukee's Gang Unit. [108] In 2014, 59 people were killed, one of the lowest tallies in Milwaukee's history. [ citation needed ] In 2015, there has been a spike in crime, with 124 killed as of October 22, 2015. [109] Poverty [ edit ] 

Milwaukee currently ranks the second poorest city with over 500,000 residents, only falling behind Detroit. [110] In 2013, a Point-In-Time survey estimated 1,500 people are homeless on Milwaukee's streets each night. [111] The city's homeless and poor are aided by several local nonprofits, including the Milwaukee Rescue Mission . Education [ edit ] Merrill Hall at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee The John P. Raynor, S.J. Library at Marquette University Wisconsin Lutheran College Primary and secondary education [ edit ] Main article: Milwaukee Public Schools 

Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) is the largest school district in Wisconsin and thirty third in the nation. As of 2007, it had an enrollment of 89,912 students [112] and as of 2006 employed 11,100 full-time and substitute teachers in 323 schools. Milwaukee Public Schools operate as magnet schools , with individualized specialty areas for interests in academics or the arts. Washington High School , Riverside University High School , Rufus King High School , Ronald Wilson Reagan College Preparatory High School , Samuel Morse Middle School for the Gifted and Talented , Golda Meir School , Milwaukee High School of the Arts , and Lynde Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School are some of the magnet schools in Milwaukee. In 2007, 17 MPS high schools appeared on a national list of "dropout factories" - schools where fewer than 60% of freshmen graduate on time. [113] Milwaukee is also home to over two dozen private or parochial high schools (e.g., St. Anthony High School , Divine Savior Holy Angels High School , Thomas More High School , Dominican High School , Messmer High School , Marquette University High School , Milwaukee Lutheran High School , Pius XI High School , St. Joan Antida High School , and University School of Milwaukee among others) and many private and parochial middle and elementary schools.

Journal Communications (a NYSE -traded corporation), in addition to owning the Journal Sentinel , also owns: WTMJ-TV; WTMJ and WKTI radio stations; and well over a dozen local weekly newspapers in the metropolitan area. As a result, it has been criticized for having a near- monopoly in local news coverage. [116] [117] 

The RedLetterMedia company, an online leader in film criticism, parody, and indie films is based in Milwaukee. Infrastructure [ edit ] Health care [ edit ] 

Milwaukee's health care industry includes several health systems. The Milwaukee Regional Medical Complex, between 8700 and 9200 West Wisconsin Avenue, is on the Milwaukee County grounds.

The Medical College of Wisconsin is one of two medical schools in Wisconsin and the only one in Milwaukee. 

Other health care non-profit organizations in Milwaukee include national headquarters of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the Endometriosis Association. Transportation [ edit ] Airports [ edit ] Timmerman Field 

Milwaukee has two airports, General Mitchell International Airport (KMKE) on the southern edge of the city, and the smaller Timmerman Field (KMWC) on the north side. Mitchell is served by nine airlines, [118] which offer roughly 240 daily departures and 245 daily arrivals. Approximately 90 cities are served nonstop or direct from Mitchell International. It is the largest airport in Wisconsin and the 34th largest in the nation. [119] The airport terminal is open 24 hours a day. Since 2005, Mitchell International Airport has been connected by the Amtrak Hiawatha train service, which provides airport access via train to Chicago and downtown Milwaukee. Southwest , Frontier Airlines , American Airlines , United Airlines , Air Canada and Delta Air Lines are among the carriers using Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport gates. [118] In July 2015, General Mitchell International Airport served 610,271 passengers. [120] Intercity rail [ edit ] The Milwaukee Intermodal Station 

Milwaukee's Amtrak station was renovated in 2007 to create the Milwaukee Intermodal Station near downtown Milwaukee and the Third Ward to provide Amtrak riders access to Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines intercity bus transportation. Milwaukee is served by the Hiawatha Amtrak express service up to seven times daily between downtown Milwaukee and downtown Chicago, including a stop at the Milwaukee Airport Railroad Station , Sturtevant, WI near Racine, WI , Glenview, IL . Amtrak operates its Empire Builder passenger train daily between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest , with stops near Madison , Wisconsin Dells and Minneapolis . In 2010, $800 million in federal funds were allocated to the creation of high-speed rail links from Milwaukee to Chicago and Madison; [121] but the funds were eventually rejected by newly elected Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker . [122] Commuter transit [ edit ] 

The Badger Bus and station in downtown Milwaukee provides bus service between Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin . Stops include the UW–Madison Memorial Union , Madison Bus Depot, Johnson Creek , Goerkes Corners, Milwaukee 84th St, Milwaukee Bus Depot (downtown Milwaukee), and Milwaukee Airport . The Milwaukee County Transit System provides bus services within Milwaukee County. The renovated Milwaukee Intermodal Station provides Jefferson Lines intercity bus riders access to Amtrak and Greyhound Lines . 

A tram system known as the Milwaukee Connector was proposed and passed by the Common Council, but Mayor Tom Barrett vetoed the bill because of problems of cost and availability. A modern streetcar system, the Milwaukee Streetcar , is now planned to connect the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, downtown Milwaukee, and Ogden Ave. Construction of the initial line is projected to cost $122 million, with work expected to start in late 2015, and the line would open in mid-2018. [123] 

A 0.5% sales tax was proposed for the counties of Milwaukee , Racine , and Kenosha by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Transit Authority to fund the KRM (Kenosha-Racine-Milwaukee) Commuter Rail project serving those cities as well as several other stops on the route. A connection to Metra commuter rail in Kenosha was planned with some trains continuing to Chicago. In Milwaukee, the line was to terminate at the Milwaukee Intermodal Station. In June 2011, authorizing legislation for regional transit authorities in Wisconsin was repealed, leading to the dissolution of the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority, which was leading the commuter rail planning. The project is currently on indefinite hold. [124] Freeways [ edit ] The Hoan Bridge 

Three of Wisconsin's Interstate highways intersect in Milwaukee. Interstate 94 (I-94) comes north from Chicago to enter Milwaukee and continues west to Madison . I-43 enters Milwaukee from the southwest and continues north along Lake Michigan to Green Bay . Approved in 2015, Interstate 41 follows I-94 north from the state line before turning west and north to head to Green Bay . Milwaukee has two auxiliary Interstate Highways, I-894 and I-794 . I-894 extends from the western suburbs to the southern suburbs, bypassing downtown. I-794 extends east from the Marquette Interchange to Lake Michigan before turning south over the Hoan Bridge toward the airport , turning into Highway 794 along the way. Milwaukee is also served by three US Highways . U.S. Highway 18 (US 18) provides a link from downtown to points west. US 41 and US 45 both provide north–south freeway transportation on the western side of the city. 

In 2010, the Milwaukee area was ranked the 4th best city for commuters by Forbes . [125] Water [ edit ] The Lake Express Terminal 

Milwaukee's main port, Port of Milwaukee , handled 2.4 million metric tons of cargo through its municipal port in 2014. [126] Steel and salt are handled at the port. 

Milwaukee connects with Muskegon, Michigan through the Lake Express high-speed auto and passenger ferry . The Lake Express travels across Lake Michigan from late spring to the fall of each year. Bicycle [ edit ] The Oak Leaf Trail on the East Side 

Milwaukee has over 105 miles (169 km) of bicycle lanes and trails, most of which run alongside or near its rivers and Lake Michigan . The Oak Leaf Trail , a multi-use recreational trail, provides bicycle trails throughout the city and county. Still pending are the creation of bicycle lanes along major commuting routes, such as the Hoan Bridge connector between downtown and the suburbs to the south. The city has also identified over 250 miles (400 km) of streets on which bike lanes will fit. It has created a plan labeling 145 miles (233 km) of those as high priority for receiving bike lanes. [127] As part of the city's Bicycle and Pedestrian Task Force's mission to "make Milwaukee more bicycle and pedestrian friendly", over 700 bike racks have been installed throughout the city. [128] The Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin [129] holds an annual Bike to Work Week. The event, held in May each year, has frequently featured a commuter race between a car, a bus, and a bike; and also a morning ride into work with the mayor. In 2006, Milwaukee obtained bronze-level status from the League of American Bicyclists, [130] a rarity for a city its size. [131] 

In 2009, the Milwaukee County Transit System began installing bicycle racks to the front of county buses. [132] This " green " effort was part of a settlement of an asbestos lawsuit leveled by the state at the county in 2006. [133] The lawsuit cites the release of asbestos into the environment when the Courthouse Annex was demolished. [134] 

In August 2014, Milwaukee debuted a bicycle sharing system called Bublr Bikes , which is a partnership between the City of Milwaukee and a local non-profit Midwest Bike Share (dba Bublr Bikes). [135] [136] As of September 2016, the system operates 39 stations throughout downtown, the East Side, and the UW-Milwaukee campus area and near downtown neighborhoods. The City of Milwaukee is scheduled to install another 10 Bublr Bikes stations in October 2016, and the adjacent suburb of Wauwatosa installed 8 stations in September 2016, which will bring the system size to 58 stations by the end of 2016. More stations are scheduled for installation in the Village of Shorewood and the City of West Allis in 2017. Future system expansion in the City of Milwaukee is also expected as the City was awarded a second federal Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality (CMAQ) program grant ($1.9 million) to add more stations starting in 2018. [137] City development [ edit ] 

On February 10, 2015, a streetcar connecting the Milwaukee Intermodal Station with the city's lower east side was approved by the Common Council, bringing if not to a halt then at least to a pause, decades of sometimes acrimonious debate. On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124 million capital budget, its estimated $3.2 million operating and maintenance budget and its 2.5-mile route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122 million, 44-story Couture. Groundbreaking is anticipated in late 2015, with full operation by mid-2018. [138] 

On September 25, 2013, Northwestern Mutual unveiled its design of a new office tower to replace their existing 16 story east tower. The building, dubbed "The Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons", would stand 550 feet tall and have 32 stories, making it the second tallest building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This along with the Couture 44-story tower would forever alter the Milwaukee Skyline. [ citation needed ] 

A new multipurpose stadium between N. Fourth Street and N. Sixth Street from W. Highland Ave. to W. Juneau Ave., [139] has been planned to accommodate the Milwaukee Bucks . Construction began in November 2015. According to Bucks officials it should open for the 2017-2018 season. The arena is intended to be the focal point of a "live block" zone that includes public space surrounded by both commercial and residential development. Initial renderings of the arena show a transparent facade and a curved roof and side meant to evoke the water forms of nearby Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee River.

Philadelphia ( / ˌ f ɪ l ə ˈ d ɛ l f i ə / ) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous in the United States , with an estimated population in 2014 of 1,560,297. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In the Northeastern United States , at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valley , a metropolitan area home to 7.2 million people and the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. 

In 1682, William Penn founded the city to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony . [11] Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States , who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War , and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C. , was under construction. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of European immigrants . It became a prime destination for African-Americans in the Great Migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950. 

Based on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy in the late 1960s Philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the USA and often overseas. [ citation needed ] As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. [12] [13] Revitalization began in the late 1990s, with gentrification turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend of population loss. 

The area's many universities and colleges make Philadelphia a top international study destination, as the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub. [14] [15] With a gross domestic product of $388 billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation. [16] Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania and is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies. The Philadelphia skyline is growing, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016 [17] including several nationally prominent skyscrapers . [18] The city is known for its arts, culture, and history, attracting over 39 million domestic tourists in 2013. [19] Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city, [20] and Fairmount Park is the largest landscaped urban park in the world. [21] The 67 National Historic Landmarks in the city helped account for the $10 billion generated by tourism. [19] Philadelphia is the birthplace of the United States Marine Corps , [22] [23] and is also the home of many U.S. firsts , including the first library (1731), [24] first hospital (1751) [24] and medical school (1765), [25] first Capitol (1777), [24] first stock exchange (1790), [24] first zoo (1874), [26] and first business school (1881). [27] Philadelphia is the only World Heritage City in the United States.

Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon . The Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government . [30] They are also called Delaware Indians [31] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed , western Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley . [a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. [31] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox , and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma , with some communities living also in Wisconsin , Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands. 

Europeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River opposite the Schuylkill River in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey . The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina (present day Wilmington, Delaware) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their military defeat of the English colony of Maryland. In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm , named New Korsholm after a town that is now in Finland. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence, although the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, but the situation did not really change until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn 's charter for Pennsylvania. Penn's Treaty with the Indians by Benjamin West 

In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony . Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. [32] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon , in what is now the city's Fishtown section . [33] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos , "love" or "friendship", and adelphos , "brother"). As a Quaker , Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. [34] Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots. [35] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin , a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals. Benjamin Franklin , 1777 

A number of important philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824). [36] These worked to develop and finance new industries and attract skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe. 

Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries . By the 1750s, Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America , and second in the British Empire, behind London . [37] [38] The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War ; the Second Continental Congress , [39] which signed the United States Declaration of Independence , during the war; and the Constitutional Convention (1787) after the war. Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well. President's House , Philadelphia. This mansion at 6th Market Streets served as the presidential mansion of George Washington and John Adams, 1790–1800. 

Philadelphia served as the temporary capital of the United States, 1790–1800, while the Federal City was under construction in the District of Columbia . [40] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemics in U.S. history killed at least 4,000 and up to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, roughly 10% of the city's population. [41] [42] 

The state government left Philadelphia in 1799, and the federal government was moved to Washington, DC in 1800 with completion of the White House and Capitol. The city remained the young nation's largest with a population of nearly 50,000 at the turn of the 19th century; it was a financial and cultural center. Before 1800, its free black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. New York City soon surpassed Philadelphia in population, but with the construction of roads, canals , and railroads, Philadelphia became the first major industrial city in the United States. Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exhibition at Memorial Hall , 1876, first World's Fair in the US. 

Throughout the 19th century, Philadelphia had a variety of industries and businesses, the largest being textiles. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works , William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company , and the Pennsylvania Railroad . [43] Industry, along with the U.S. Centennial , was celebrated in 1876 with the Centennial Exposition , the first official World's Fair in the United States. Immigrants, mostly Irish and German, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854 , which extended the city limits of Philadelphia from the 2 square miles of present-day Center City to the roughly 130 square miles of Philadelphia County . [44] [45] Library and Surgeon's Hall , Fifth-street. 

These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic Nativist riots had erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city. [46] Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559. [47] [48] Twentieth-century black newcomers were part of the Great Migration out of the rural South to northern and midwestern industrial cities.

By the 20th century, Philadelphia had become known as "corrupt and contented", with a complacent population and an entrenched Republican political machine . [49] The first major reform came in 1917 when outrage over the election-year murder of a police officer led to the shrinking of the Philadelphia City Council from two houses to just one. [50] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during Red Summer , in post-World War I unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brigadier General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption. [51] 

In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population. [52] The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s. They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population. [53] [54] Geography A simulated-color image of Philadelphia and the Delaware River, taken by NASA 's Landsat 7 satellite Topography 

Philadelphia is at 39° 57′ north latitude and 75° 10′ west longitude, and the 40th parallel north passes through the northern parts of the city. The city encompasses 142.6 square miles (369.3 km 2 ), of which 135.1 square miles (349.9 km 2 ) is land and 7.6 square miles (19.7 km 2 ), or 5.29%, is water. Bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, and Cobbs , Wissahickon , and Pennypack creeks. 

The lowest point is 10 feet (3 m) above sea level, while the highest point is in Chestnut Hill , about 445 feet (136 m) above sea level (near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike). [55] 

Philadelphia sits on the Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Coastal Plain from the Piedmont . [56] The rapids on the Schuylkill River at East Falls were inundated by the completion of the Fairmount Dam. [57] 

The city is the seat of its own county . The adjacent counties are Montgomery to the north; Bucks to the northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey , to the east; Camden County, New Jersey , to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey , to the south; and Delaware County to the west.

Philadelphia's central city was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn 's surveyor Thomas Holme . Center City is structured with long straight streets running east-west and north-south forming a grid pattern. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire. [58] The Delaware River and Schuylkill Rivers served as early boundaries between which the city's early street plan was kept within. In addition, Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824 [58] (in parenthesis): Centre Square , North East Publick Square ( Franklin Square ), Northwest Square ( Logan Square ), Southwest Square ( Rittenhouse Square ), and Southeast Square ( Washington Square ). [59] Center City has grown into the second-most populated downtown area in the United States, after Midtown Manhattan in New York City, with an estimated 183,240 residents in 2015. [60] 

Philadelphia's neighborhoods are divided into large sections— North , Northeast , Northwest , West , South and Southwest Philadelphia —all of which surround Center City , which corresponds closely with the city's limits before consolidation in 1854. Each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that made up Philadelphia County before their absorption into the city. [61] Elfreth's Alley , "Our nation's oldest residential street", dating to 1702. [62] 

The City Planning Commission , tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the Philadelphia2035 physical development plan. [63] [64] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007–2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter . The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning mapping that would streamline future community preferences and development, which the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs to be added to Philadelphia in 2035. 

The Philadelphia Housing Authority is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, it is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, housing about 84,000 people and employing 1,250. In 2013, its budget was $371 million. [65] The Philadelphia Parking Authority works to ensure adequate parking for city residents, businesses and visitors. [66] 



Architecture Main articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia Christ Church , a sophisticated example of Georgian architecture. [67] 

Philadelphia's architectural history dates back to Colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were of logs construction, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture , including Independence Hall and Christ Church . Center City Philadelphia , showing the One Liberty Place skyscraper behind City Hall and their contrast in architectural styles. Georgian style homes in Society Hill . 

In the first decades of the 19th century, Federal architecture and Greek Revival architecture were dominated by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe , William Strickland , John Haviland , John Notman , Thomas U. Walter , and Samuel Sloan . [68] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century, but his contemporaries included John McArthur, Jr. , Addison Hutton , Wilson Eyre , the Wilson Brothers , and Horace Trumbauer . In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire -style Philadelphia City Hall . The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places , adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit. [69] 

In 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first International Style skyscraper in the United States, The PSFS Building , designed by George Howe and William Lescaze . It is the United States' first modern skyscraper and considered the most important one built in the first part of the 20th century. 

The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was constructed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Philadelphia's Center City from the late 1980s onwards. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Innovation and Technology Center is under construction in Center City and is planned to reach a height of 1,121 feet (342 meters); upon completion, the tower is expected to be the tallest skyscraper in the United States outside of New York City and Chicago. [18] 

For much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house . The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as "Philadelphia rows". [68] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes are scattered throughout the city, much of the housing is from the early 20th century or older. The great age of the homes has created numerous problems, including blight and vacant lots in many parts of the city, while other neighborhoods such as Society Hill , which has the largest concentration of 18th-century architecture in the United States, have been rehabilitated and gentrified.

Under the Köppen climate classification , Philadelphia falls in the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cfa ). [72] Under the Trewartha climate classification , the city has a temperate maritime climate ( Do ). [73] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cold. 

Snowfall is highly variable, with some winters bringing only light snow and others bringing several major snowstorms, with the normal seasonal snowfall standing at 22.4 in (57 cm); snow in November or April is rare, and a sustained snow cover is rare.

The total parkland amounts to about 10,334 acres (41.82 km 2 ). [140] Philadelphia's largest park, Fairmount Park , encompasses 9,200 acres (37 km 2 ) of this parkland and includes 63 neighborhood and regional parks. [141] The largest tract of Fairmount Park is on the west side of the city along the Schuylkill River and Wissahickon Creek and includes the Philadelphia Zoo . 

The total expenditures of the park in 2005 were $164 million. Fairmount Park is the world's largest landscaped urban park . [21] Law and government City Hall , Philadelphia's tallest building until 1987. 

From a governmental perspective, Philadelphia County is a legal nullity , as all county functions were assumed by the city in 1952, which has been coterminous with the county since 1854. 

Philadelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an Act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing City Council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951. [142] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952. [143] 

The city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor-council form of government, which is headed by one mayor, in whom executive authority is vested. Elected at-large , the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms under the city's home rule charter, but can run for the position again after an intervening term. The Mayor is Jim Kenney , who replaced Michael Nutter , who served two terms from 2009 to January 2016. Kenney, as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952, is a member of the Democratic Party , which tends to dominate local politics so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely covered than the general election. The legislative branch, the Philadelphia City Council , consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large. Democrats currently hold 14 seats, with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority party, as well as the Northeast-based Tenth District. The current council president is Darrell Clarke . Courts 

The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (First Judicial District) is the trial court of general jurisdiction for Philadelphia, hearing felony -level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $7000 (excepting small claims cases valued between $7000 and $12000 and landlord-tenant issues heard in the Municipal Court) under its original jurisdiction ; it also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts and over decisions of certain Pennsylvania state agencies (e.g. the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board ). It has 90 legally trained judges elected by the voters. It is funded and operated largely by city resources and employees. [144] The current District Attorney is Seth Williams , a Democrat. The last Republican to hold the office is Ron Castille , who left in 1991 and is currently the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 

The Philadelphia Municipal Court handles matters of limited jurisdiction as well as landlord-tenant disputes, appeals from traffic court, preliminary hearings for felony-level offenses, and misdemeanor criminal trials. It has 25 legally trained judges elected by the voters. [145] 

Philadelphia Traffic Court is a court of special jurisdiction that hears violations of traffic laws. It has seven judges elected by the voters. [146] As with magisterial district judges, the judges need not be lawyers, but must complete the certifying course and pass the qualifying examination administered by the Minor Judiciary Education Board. [147] 

Pennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania , the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall . Also, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania sit in Philadelphia several times a year. Judges for these courts are elected at large. Each court has a prothonotary 's office in Philadelphia as well. 

Additionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , both of which are housed in the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse .

As of December 31, 2009, there were 1,057,038 registered voters in Philadelphia. [148] Registered voters constitute 68.3% of the total population. [149] Democratic : 829,873 (78.5%) Republican : 134,216 (12.7%) Libertarian 2,631 (0.2%) Other Parties and No party: 90,318 (8.5%) [148] 

From the American Civil War until the mid-20th century, Philadelphia was a bastion of the Republican Party , which arose from the staunch pro-Northern views of Philadelphia residents during and after the war (Philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first Republican National Convention in 1856 ). After the Great Depression , Democratic registrations increased, but the city was not carried by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 (in which Pennsylvania was one of the few states won by Republican Herbert Hoover ). Four years later, however, voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the Democrats. Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote in 1936 . The city has remained loyally Democratic in every presidential election since. It is now one of the most Democratic in the country; in 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. 

Philadelphia once comprised six congressional districts . However, as a result of the city's declining population, it now has only four: the 1st district , represented by Bob Brady ; the 2nd , represented by Chaka Fattah ; the 8th , represented by Mike Fitzpatrick ; and the 13th , represented by Brendan Boyle . All but Fitzpatrick are Democrats. Although they are usually swamped by Democrats in city, state and national elections, Republicans still have some support in the area, primarily in the northeast . A Republican represented a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House as late as 1983, and Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in both 1999 and 2003 . 

Pennsylvania's longest-serving Senator , [150] Arlen Specter , was from Philadelphia; he served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011. He was also the city's District Attorney from 1966 to 1974. 

Philadelphia has hosted various national conventions , including in 1848 (Whig) , 1856 (Republican) , 1872 (Republican) , 1900 (Republican) , 1936 (Democratic) , 1940 (Republican) , 1948 (Republican) , 1948 (Progressive) , and 2000 (Republican) . Philadelphia will host the 2016 Democratic National Convention . [151] Philadelphia has been home to one Vice President , George M. Dallas , and one Civil War general who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election: George B. McClellan .

Like many American cities, Philadelphia saw a gradual yet pronounced rise in crime in the years following World War II. There were 525 murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. There were an average of about 600 murders a year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose four years later to 406 in 2006 and 392 in 2007. [152] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid drop in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, there were 246 murders, which is a decrease of over 25% from the previous year, and a decrease of over 44% since 2007. [153] And in 2014, there were 248 homicides, up by one since 2013. [100] 

In 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities. [154] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. And in 2014, the rate dropped to 16.0 homicides per 100,000 residents placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country. [100] 

In 2004, there were 7,513.5 crimes per 200,000 people in Philadelphia. [155] Among its neighboring Mid-Atlantic cities in the same population group, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. were ranked second- and third-most dangerous cities in the United States, respectively. [156] Camden , New Jersey, a city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was ranked as the most dangerous city in the United States. [156] 

The number of shootings in the city has declined significantly in the last 10 years. Shooting incidents peaked in 2006 when 1,857 shootings were recorded. That number has dropped 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014. [100] Similarly, major crimes in the city has decreased gradually in the last ten years since its peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. In the past three years, the number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent to a total of 68,815. Violent crimes , which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in the past three years with a reported 15,771 occurrences in 2014. [100] Based on the rate of violent crimes per 1,000 residents in American cities with 25,000 people or more, Philadelphia was ranked as the 54th most dangerous city in 2015.

The city's K-12 enrollment in district run schools has dropped in the last five years from 156,211 students in 2010 to 130,104 students in 2015. During the same time period, the enrollment in charter schools has increased from 33,995 students in 2010 to 62,358 students in 2015. [100] This consistent drop in enrollment has led the city to close 24 of its public schools in 2013. [160] During the 2014 school year, the city spent an average of $12,570 per pupil, below the average among comparable urban school districts. [100] 

Graduation rates among district-run schools, meanwhile, have steadily increased in the last ten years. In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52%. This number has increased to 65% in 2014, still below the national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) have trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but have decreased since. In 2005, the district-run schools scored an average of 37.4% on math and 35.5% on reading. The city's schools reached its peak scores in 2011 with 59.0% on math and 52.3% on reading.

In 1981, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding. Several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas, but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation. These projects include the proposed Schuylkill Valley Metro to Wyomissing, PA, and extension of the Media/Elwyn line back to Wawa, PA. SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line Regional Rail offers direct service to the Philadelphia International Airport .

Woodhaven Road ( Route 63 ), built in 1966, and Cottman Avenue ( Route 73 ) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia , running between Interstate 95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard ( U.S. 1 ). The Fort Washington Expressway ( Route 309 ) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County . U.S. 30 , extending east-west from West Philadelphia to Lancaster , is known as Lancaster Avenue throughout most of the city and through the adjacent Main Line suburbs. The Ben Franklin Bridge , viewed at night from Center City toward Camden, New Jersey 

Interstate 476 , commonly nicknamed the "Blue Route" through Delaware County , bypasses the city to the west, serving the city's western suburbs, as well as providing a link to Allentown and points north. Similarly, Interstate 276 , the Pennsylvania Turnpike 's Delaware River Extension, acts as a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city as well as a link to the New Jersey Turnpike to New York. 

However, other planned freeways have been canceled, such as an Interstate 695 running southwest from downtown; two freeways connecting Interstate 95 to Interstate 76 that would have replaced Girard Avenue and South Street; and a freeway upgrade of Roosevelt Boulevard . 

The Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey : the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and US 30 ), the Betsy Ross Bridge ( Route 90 ), and the Commodore Barry Bridge ( US 322 ). The Tacony-Palmyra Bridge connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey's Route 73 in Palmyra , Camden County , and is maintained by the Burlington County Bridge Commission . Bus service 

Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound Lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi River . Most of Greyhound's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal , located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia. In 2006, the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States, after the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York. Besides Greyhound, six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal: Bieber Tourways, Capitol Trailways, Martz Trailways , Peter Pan Bus Lines , Susquehanna Trailways, and the bus division for New Jersey Transit . Other services include Megabus and Bolt Bus . Rail Main article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia Suburban Station with art deco architecture 

Since the early days of rail transport in the United States , Philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad . The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station , then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station , and the Reading Railroad operated out of Reading Terminal , now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center . The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact but now connected, operate as a single system under the control of the SEPTA , the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit 's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey . [174] 

Philadelphia, once home to more than 4,000 trolleys on 65 lines, [175] is one of the few North American cities to maintain streetcar lines. Today, SEPTA operates five "subway-surface" trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City . SEPTA also recently [ when? ] reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line , Route 15. 

Today, Philadelphia is a regional hub of the federally owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh . 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in numbers of passengers as of fiscal year 2013. [176] Walkability 

A 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fourth most walkable major city in the United States. [177] Utilities Fairmount Water Works , Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks. 

Historically, Philadelphia sourced its water by the Fairmount Water Works , the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods. [178] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water , wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River . [179] The public wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles of sewers. [179] A 2007 investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency found elevated levels of Iodine-131 in the city's potable water . [180] [181] In 2012, the EPA's readings discovered that the city had the highest readings of I-131 in the nation. The city campaigned against an Associated Press report that the high levels of I-131 were the results of local gas drilling in the Upper Delaware River. [182] 

PECO Energy Company , founded as the Philadelphia Electric Company in 1881, [183] provides electricity to over 1.6 million customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania. [184] The company has over 500 power substations and 29,000 miles of distribution of transmission lines in its service making it the largest combination utility in the state. 

Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally owned natural gas utility. It serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area. [185] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the Philadelphia City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer. [186] [187] 

Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the " Bell System " went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas ( area code 445 to 215, area code 835 to 610) was delayed and later rescinded. [188] 

An effort was approved on 2005 to provide low-cost, citywide Wi-Fi service to the city. Wireless Philadelphia would have been the first municipal internet utility offering in a large US city, but the plan was abandoned in 2008 as EarthLink pushed back the completion date several times. Mayor Nutter's administration closed the project in 2009 after an attempt to revitalize it failed. [189] Notable people Main article: List of people from Philadelphia Twin towns – Sister cities Chinatown Gate at 10th and Arch, a symbol of Philadelphia's friendship with Tianjin . 

Philadelphia has eight official sister cities , as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International – Philadelphia: [190] City Country Date Florence [191] Italy 1964 Tel Aviv [192] Israel 1966 Toruń [193] Poland 1976 Tianjin [194] China 1980 Incheon [195] South Korea 1984 Douala [196] Cameroon 1986 Nizhny Novgorod [197] Russia 1992 Frankfurt [198] Germany 2015 

Philadelphia also has three partnership cities or regions: [190] City Country Date Kobe [199] Japan 1986 Abruzzo [200] Italy 1997 Aix-en-Provence [201] France 1999 

Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. Dedicated in June 1976, the Sister Cities Plaza, a site of 0.5 acres (2,000 m 2 ) located at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway, honors Philadelphia's relationships with Tel Aviv and Florence which were its first sister cities. Another landmark, the Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń , Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In addition, the Triangle contains the Copernicus monument. Renovations were made to Sister Cities Park in mid-2011 and on May 10, 2012, SCP was reopened and currently features an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's ten sister and friendship cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards. [202] 

The Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin , stands astride the intersection of 10th and Arch Streets as an elaborate and colorful symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State 's "Partners for Peace" project with Mosul, Iraq , [203] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.

These terrains encompass from South to North and then counter-clockwise: the shores from the east-shore mouth of the river and the sea coast to Western Long Island (all of both colonial New York City and New Jersey ), and portions of Western Connecticut up to the latitude of the Massachusetts corner of today's boundaries—making the eastern bounds of their influence, thence their region extended: westerly past the region around Albany, NY to the Susquehanna River side of the Catskills , then southerly through the eastern Poconos outside the rival Susquehannock lands past Eastern Pennsylvania then southerly past the site of Colonial Philadelphia past the west bank mouth of the Delaware and extending south from that point along a stretch of sea coast in northern colonial Delaware . 

The Susquehanna-Delaware watershed divides bound the frequently contested 'hunting grounds' between the rival Susquehannock peoples and the Lenape peoples, whilst the Catskills and Berkshires played a similar boundary role in the northern regions of their original colonial era range. ^ See North American blizzard of 2009#Snowfall (December 19–20, 2009), First North American blizzard of 2010#Snowfall (February 5–6, 2010), and Second North American blizzard of 2010#Impact (February 9–10, 2010). The February storms contributed to a record (for any month) monthly total accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall. ^ The last occurrence of such a temperature was July 18, 2012. ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010. ^ Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present. [79] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively. [74] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport. [80] ^ E.g., in the opening chapter of The Handbook of Language Variation and Change (ed. Chambers et al., Blackwell 2002), J.K. Chambers writes that "variationist sociolinguistics had its effective beginnings only in 1963, the year in which William Labov presented the first sociolinguistic research report"; the dedication page of the Handbook says that Labov's "ideas imbue every page".

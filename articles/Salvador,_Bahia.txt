Salvador , also known as São Salvador , [4] [5] Salvador de Bahia , [6] and Salvador da Bahia [7] ( Brazilian Portuguese: [sawvaˈdoʁ da baˈi.ɐ] ), [n 1] is the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia . With 2.9 million people (2013) , it is the largest city proper in the Northeast Region and the 3rd-largest city proper in the country, after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro . 

Founded by the Portuguese in 1549 as the first capital of Brazil , Salvador is one of the oldest colonial cities in the Americas . A sharp escarpment divides its Lower Town ( Cidade Baixa ) from its Upper Town ( Cidade Alta ) by some 85 meters (279 ft). The Elevador Lacerda , Brazil's first elevator , has connected the two since 1873. The Pelourinho district of the upper town, still home to many examples of Portuguese colonial architecture and historical monuments, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. The city's cathedral is the see of the primate of Brazil and its Carnival celebration has been reckoned as the largest party in the world. Salvador was the first slave port in the Americas and the African influence of the slaves' descendants makes it a center of Afro-Brazilian ( preto ) culture. The city is noted for its cuisine , music , and architecture . Porto da Barra Beach in Barra has been named one of the best beaches in the world. Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova was the site of the city's games during the 2014 Brazilian World Cup . 

Salvador forms the heart of the Recôncavo , Bahia's rich agricultural and industrial maritime district, and continues to be a major Brazilian port. Its metropolitan area, housing 3,953,290 people (2015) forms the wealthiest one in Brazil's Northeast Region .

Salvador lies on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates the Bay of All Saints from the Atlantic Ocean . The bay is the largest in Brazil and the 2nd-largest in the world. [8] It was first reached by Gaspar de Lemos in 1501, just one year after Cabral 's purported discovery of Brazil . [9] During his second voyage for Portugal , the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci sighted the bay on All Saints' Day (November 1) 1502 and, in honor of the date and his parish church in Florence , he named it the Bay of the Holy Savior of All the Saints . [10] The first European to settle nearby was Diogo Álvares Correia ("Caramuru"), [11] who was shipwrecked off the end of the peninsula in 1509. He lived among the Tupinambá , marrying Guaibimpara and others. In 1531, Martim Afonso de Sousa led an expedition from Mount St Paul ( Morro de São Paulo ) [12] and, in 1534, Francisco Pereira Coutinho , the first captain of Bahia , established the settlement of Pereira in modern Salvador's Ladeira da Barra neighborhood. Mistreatment of the Tupinambá by the settlers caused them to turn hostile and the Portuguese were forced to flee to Porto Seguro c.  1546 . [13] An attempted restoration of the colony the next year ended in shipwreck and cannibalism . [14] 

The present city was established as the fortress of São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos ("Holy Savior of the Bay of All Saints") [15] [n 2] in 1549 by Portuguese settlers under Tomé de Sousa , Brazil 's first governor-general . [16] It is one of the oldest cities founded by Europeans in the Americas . [17] From a cliff overlooking the Bay of All Saints, [n 3] it served as Brazil's first capital and quickly became a major port for its slave trade and sugarcane industry. [19] Salvador was long divided into an upper and a lower city, divided by a sharp escarpment some 85 meters (279 ft) high. [20] The upper city formed the administrative, religious, and primary residential districts while the lower city was the commercial center, with a port and market. 

In the Catholic Church , Brazil and the rest of the Portuguese Empire were initially administered as part of the Diocese of Funchal in Portugal but, in 1551, Salvador became the seat of the first Catholic diocese erected in Brazil. [21] The first parish church [22] was the mud-and-thatch Church of Our Lady of Help ( Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Ajuda ) erected by the Jesuits , [n 4] which served as the first cathedral of the diocese until the Jesuits finished construction of the original basilica on the Terreiro de Jesus in 1553. [22] [n 5] Its bishop was made independent of Lisbon at the request of King Pedro II in 1676; [25] he served as the primate of Congo and Angola until the elevation of Luanda on 13 January 1844 and still serves as the national primate of Brazil. 

In 1572, the Governorate of Brazil was divided into the separate governorates of Bahia in the north and Rio de Janeiro in the south. These were reunited as Brazil six years later, then redivided from 1607 to 1613. By that time, Portugal had become united with Spain and was ruled from Madrid by its kings. In 1621, King Philip III replaced the Governorate of Brazil with the states of Brazil , still based in Salvador and now controlling the south, and the Maranhão , which was centered on São Luís and controlled what is now northern Brazil. As Spain was then prosecuting a war against the independence of the Dutch , the Dutch East and West India companies tried to conquer Brazil from them. Salvador played a strategically vital role against Dutch Brazil , but was captured and sacked by a West India Company fleet under Jacob Willekens and Piet Hein on 10 May 1624. Johan van Dorth administered the colony before his assassination, freeing its slaves . The city was recaptured by a Luso-Spanish fleet under Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Mendoza on 1 May 1625. John Maurice 's two subsequent attempts to retake the town in April and May of 1638 were unsuccessful. Monument dedicated to the heroes of the battles of Bahia's independence from Portugal in the Campo Grande Square. 

In 1763, the colonial administration was removed to Rio de Janeiro and elevated to a viceroyalty . Salvador remained the heart of the Recôncavo , Bahia's rich agricultural maritime district, [26] but was largely outside Brazil's early modernization. The area formed a center of royal support against Pedro I 's declaration of independence on September 7, 1822. Its elites initially remained loyal to the Portuguese crown [5] while rebels from Cachoeira besieged them for a year until finally receiving Portugal's surrender of the town on July 2, 1823, which is now celebrated as Bahia Independence Day. [ citation needed ] The local elite was similarly hesitant during Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca 's coup that established the republic by in 1889. [5] 

Owing to whales' use of the Bay of All Saints as a mating ground, Salvador became a large whaling port during the 19th century but the trade had already begun to fall off by the 1870s. [4] 

Under the empire and republic , however, the town slowly began to industrialize. In 1873, Brazil's first elevator, the powerful hydraulic Elevador Lacerda , was constructed to connect the city's upper and lower towns. [4] Having undergone several upgrades, it continues in use. [27] [28] By the First World War , it was joined by a second elevator [n 6] and Salvador was connected to four railroads : the Bahia Alagoinhas to Joazeiro , the Bahia Central , the Nazareth Tramway , and a short line to Santo Amaro . [5] Its central districts and the major suburbs of Bomsim and Victoria were served by four streetcar lines , [4] [5] which had begun to electrify. [5] It also served as a port of call for most steamship lines trading between Europe and South America. [5] 

In 1985, UNESCO listed the city's Pelourinho neighborhood as a World Heritage Site . [6] [29] In the 1990s, a major municipal project cleaned and restored the neighborhood in order to develop it as the cultural center and heart of the city's tourist trade. The development of the Historical Center , however, involved the forced removal of thousands of working-class residents and now necessitates local and municipal events in order to attract people to the area. [30] The relocated workers, meanwhile, have encountered significant economic hardship in their new homes on the city's periphery, separated from access to work and civic amenities. [31] 

In 2007, Porto da Barra Beach in Barra was named by the British Guardian newspaper as the 3rd-best beach in the world. [32] In 2010, the city hosted the 12th UN Congress on Crime Prevention . [33] The city hosted the 2013 Confederations Cup and was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil at its Arena Fonte Nova . [34] As part of its preparations for the World Cup, the city reëstablished its public transportation lines as the Salvador Metro . Climate [ edit ] 

Salvador has a tropical rainforest climate ( Köppen : Af ) with no discernible dry season due to no month having an average rainfall of less than 60 mm. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the course of the year. [35] [36] Salvador's driest month of the year is September, when the city receives on average 10 cm (4 in) of precipitation. Salvador's wettest months are between April and June when at least 20 cm (8 in) of rain falls during each of these four months.

In 2010, the city of Salvador was the third-most populous city in Brazil , after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro . [44] The city had 474,827 opposite-sex couples and 1,595 same-sex couples . The population of Salvador was 53.3% female and 46.7% male . [45] 

According to the 2010 IBGE Census , there were 2,480,790 people residing in the city of Salvador. [46] The census revealed the following self-identification: 1,382,543 persons identify as Pardo ( Multiracial ) (51.7%); 743,718 as Black (27.8%); 505,645 as White (18.9%); 35,785 as Asian (1.3%); and 7,563 as Amerindian (0.3%). [45] 

Salvador's population is the result of 500 years of miscegenation. The majority of the population has African, European and Native American roots. The African ancestry of the city is from Angola , Benin , Congo , Ethiopia , Nigeria , Senegal and Mozambique . [47] 

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2008, the ancestral heritage of the population of Salvador was estimated to be 49.20% African , 36.30% European and 14.50% Native American . [48] The study also analyzed the genetic backgrounds of people by type of surname. Those with surnames with a religious connotation were 53.1% African in genetic ancestry and tended to be in lower economic classes. During the colonial era, it was typical practice for Portuguese priests and missionaries to baptize converted African slaves and Native Americans with surnames of religious connotations. These have been passed down to their descendants. 

A 2015 autosomal DNA study found out the following ancestral composition in Salvador: 50.5% of African ancestry, 42.4% of European ancestry and 5.8% of Native American ancestry. [49] [50] The researchers explained they oversampled individuals living in poor environments (page 4). [51] 

Another 2015 autosomal DNA found out Salvador to be 50.8% African, 42.9% European and 6.4% Native American. [52] 

And another autosomal DNA study, also in 2015, found out Salvador to be: 50.8% European, 40.5% African and 8.7% Native American. [53] Population growth [ edit ] Changing demographics of the city of Salvador

Perspective of the Cross and Church of São Francisco in Anchieta Plaza, Pelourinho, created from a Laser Scan preservationist project conducted by nonprofit CyArk . 

In Salvador, religion is a major contact point between Portuguese and African influences and, in the last 20 years, Brazil's version of a North American-influenced Pentecostalism. [55] Salvador was the seat of the first bishopric in colonial Brazil (established 1551), and the first bishop, Pero Fernandes Sardinha , arrived already in 1552. [56] The Jesuits , led by the Manuel da Nóbrega , also arrived in the 16th century and worked in converting the Indigenous peoples of the region to Roman Catholicism . 

Many religious orders came to the city, following its foundation: Franciscans , Benedictines and Carmelites . Subsequently, to them are created the Third Orders, the Brotherhoods, and Fraternities, which were composed mainly of professional and social groups. The most prominent of these orders were the Terceira do Carmo Order and the de São Francisco Order, founded by white men, and the Nossa Senhora do Rosário and São Beneditino Brotherhoods, composed of black men. [57] In many churches maintained by religious men, were housed the Santíssimo Sacramento brotherhoods. 

Besides these organizations, the expansion of Catholicism in the city was consolidated through social care work. Santa Casa the Misericórdia was one of the institution that did this kind of work, maintaining hospitals, shelters for the poor and the elderly, as well providing assistance to convicts and to those who would face death penalties. [57] The convents , on their part, were cultural and religious formation centers, offering seminar coursed that often were attended by the lay. 

Even with the present evolution, and the growth of Protestantism and other religions in the city, the Catholic faith remains as one of its most distinctive features, drawing a lot of people to its hundreds of churches. Some aspects, like the use of Portuguese in the Masses, the simplification of the liturgy, and the adoption of " pop " religious songs are key factors to the triumph of Catholicism . In the Nossa Senhora do Rosário dos Pretos Church, Masses are held in the Yorubá language, making use of African chants and typical clothes, which attract many people from the African Brazilian communities. [57] 

Most enslaved Africans in Bahia were brought from Sub-Saharan Africa , especially the Yoruba-speaking nation ( Iorubá or Nagô in Portuguese) from present-day Benin . The enslaved were forced to convert to Roman Catholicism, but their original religion Yorùbá was combined with Roman Catholicism to make the syncretic religion known as, Candomblé , which has survived in spite of prohibitions and persecutions. The enslaved Africans managed to preserve their religion by attributing the names and characteristics of their Yorùbá deities to Catholic saints with similar qualities. Still today all Candomble sessions are conducted in Yoruba, not Portuguese. 

These religious entities have been syncretised with some Catholic entities. For instance, Salvador's Feast of Bonfim , celebrated in January, is dedicated to both Our Lord of Bonfim ( Jesus Christ ) and Oxalá. Another important feast is the Feast de Yemanja every 2 February, on the shores of the borough of Rio Vermelho in Salvador, on the day the church celebrates Our Lady of the Navigators. 8 December, Immaculate Conception Day for Catholics, is also commonly dedicated to Yemanja' with votive offerings made in the sea throughout the Brazilian coast.

Throughout Brazilian history Salvador has played an important role. Because of its location on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the Portuguese empire throughout the colonial era , maintaining close commercial ties with Portugal and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [59] 

Salvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by Rio de Janeiro . In the last ten years many high-rise office and apartment buildings were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings. [60] 

With its beaches, humid tropical climate, numerous up-to-date shopping malls (The Shopping Iguatemi was the first Shopping in Northeastern Brazil) and pleasant high-class residential areas, the city has much to offer its residents. 

Economically Salvador is one of Brazil's more important cities. Since its founding the city has been one of Brazil's most prominent ports and international trading centers. Boasting a large oil refinery, a petrochemical plant and other important industries, the city has made great strides in reducing its historical dependence on agriculture for its prosperity. [61] 

Salvador is the second most popular tourism destination in Brazil, after Rio de Janeiro . [62] Tourism and cultural activity are important generators of employment and income, boosting the arts and the preservation of artistic and cultural heritage. 

Chief among the points of interest are its famous Pelourinho (named after the colonial pillories that once stood there) district, its historic churches, [63] and its beaches . Salvador's tourism infrastructure is considered one of the most modern in World, especially in terms of lodging. The city offers accommodation to suit all tastes and standards, from youth hostels to international hotels . Construction is one of the most important activities in the city, and many international (mainly from Spain, Portugal and England) [64] and national developers are investing in the city and in the Bahian littoral zone . 

Ford Motor Company has a plant in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, in the city of Camaçari , assembling the Ford EcoSport , Ford Fiesta , Ford Fiesta Sedan . [65] It was the first Automotive industry in Northeastern Brazil . The industry employs 800 engineers. [66] 

JAC Motors will have a plant in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, in the city of Camaçari, the new industry will result 3,500 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs, the production of 100,000 vehicles by year. [67] 

In December 2001, Monsanto Company inaugurated, at the Petrochemical Pole of Camaçari, in Metropolitan Region of Salvador, the first plant of the company designed to produce raw materials for the herbicide Roundup in South America . The investment is equivalent to US$500 millions; US$350 millions were spent in this initial phase. The Camaçari Plant, the largest unit of Monsanto outside of the United States, is also the only Monsanto plant manufacturing raw materials for the Roundup production line. The company started the civil works for the new plant in January 2000.

Literature [ edit ] Perspective view of the Salvador Bahia Pelourinho's Anchieta Plaza, cut from a Laser Scan preservationist project conducted by nonprofit CyArk . 

Gregório de Mattos , born in Salvador in 1636, was also educated by the Jesuits. He became the most important Baroque poet in colonial Brazil for his religious and satirical works. Father António Vieira was born in Lisbon in 1608, but was raised and educated in the Jesuit school of Salvador and died in the city in 1697. His erudite sermons have earned him the title of best writer of the Portuguese language in the Baroque era. [82] 

After the Independence of Brazil (1822), Salvador continued to play an important role in Brazilian literature. Significant 19th century writers associated with the city include Romantic poet Castro Alves (1847–1871) and diplomat Ruy Barbosa (1849–1923). In the 20th century, Bahia-born Jorge Amado (1912–2001), although not born in Salvador, helped popularize the culture of the city around the world in novels such as Jubiabá , Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos , and Tenda dos Milagres , the settings of which are in Salvador. [83] Cuisine [ edit ] Acarajé is a traditional street food in Salvador. 

The local cuisine, spicy and based on seafood (shrimp, fish), strongly relies on typically African ingredients and techniques, and is much appreciated throughout Brazil and internationally. The most typical ingredient is azeite-de-dendê , an oil extracted from a palm tree ( Elaeis guineensis ) brought from West Africa to Brazil during colonial times. [84] 

Using the milky coconut juice, they prepared a variety of seafood based dishes, such as Ensopados, Moquecas and Escabeche. The sugar cane bagasse was mixed with molasses and Rapadura, in the creation of coconut desserts like Cocada Branca and Preta. The remaining of the Portuguese Stew sauce was mixed with manioc flour to make a mush, which is a traditional Indian dish. [85] In the markets of Salvador, it is possible to find stands selling typical dishes of the colonial era. In the Sete Portas Market, customers eat Mocotó on Friday nights since the 1940s, when the market was inaugurated. In the restaurants of Mercado Modelo , Sarapatel, stews and several fried dishes are served regularly. In the São Joaquim, Santa Bárbara and São Miguel markets, there are stands selling typical food. They are also sold at stands located on the beaches , specially crab stews and oysters. The restaurants that sell typical dishes are located mostly along the coast and in Pelourinho. They prepare a wide variety of recipes that take palm tree oil . 

Traditional dishes include caruru , vatapá , acarajé , bobó-de-camarão , moqueca baiana, and abará . Some of these dishes, like the acarajé and abará, are also used as offerings in Candomblé rituals. But Salvador is not only typical food . Other recipes created by the slaves were the Haussá Rice (rice and jerked beef cooked together), the Munguzá, used as offering to the Candomblé deity Oxalá (who is the father of all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons very much. So did the Bolinhos the Fubá, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipetê (used in the rituals to the deity Oxum ) became the Shrimp bobó , and the Akará (honoring the deities Xangô and Iansã) became the world-famous Acarajé. The city has restaurants specialized on international cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of Brazil , especially from Minas Gerais and the Northeast region . Capoeira [ edit ] Capoeira in Salvador. 

Capoeira is a unique mix of dance and martial art of Afro-Brazilian origin, combining agile dance moves with unarmed combat techniques. Capoeira in Portuguese literally means "chicken coop". The presence of capoeira in Brazil is directly connected to the importation of African slaves by the Portuguese, and Salvador is considered the home of modern capoeira branches. [86] In the first half of the 20th century, Salvador-born masters Mestre Bimba and Mestre Pastinha founded capoeira schools and helped standardize and popularize the art in Brazil and the world. The practice of Capoeira was banned in 1892, though in 1937 it was made legal . [87] In recent years, Capoeira has become more international and accessible even in Salvador.

The craftsmen and women generally choose religion as the main theme of their work. 

They portray the images of Catholic saints and Candomble deities on their pieces. The good luck charms such as the clenched fist, the four-leaf clover, the garlic and the famous Bonfim ribbons express the city's religious syncretism. Nature is also portrayed on these pieces, reflecting the local wildlife . Music appears in the atabaque drums, the rain sticks, the water drums and the famous berimbau, along with other typical instruments. [96] 

Salvador holds an international reputation as a city where musical instruments that produce unique sounds are made.

Neighborhoods [ edit ] Barra neighborhood in South Zone. 

Although the creation of Salvador was masterminded by the Kingdom of Portugal and its project conducted by the Portuguese engineer Luís Dias (who was responsible for the city's original design), the continuous growth of the capital through the decades was completely spontaneous. [ citation needed ] The walls of the city-fortress could not hold the expansion of the city, towards the Carmo and the area where now stands Castro Alves Square. At the time of its foundation, Salvador had only two squares and the first neighborhood ever built here was the Historic City Center. Pelourinho and Carmo came subsequently, created as a consequence of the growing need of space that the religious orders had. With the rapid expansion, the neighborhoods grew and many of them were clustered in the same area, so today there are not accurate records as to their exact number. For urban management purposes, the city is currently divided on 17 political-administrative zones. However, due to their very cultural relevance and to postal conveniences, the importance of the neighborhoods of Salvador remains intact. [105] Aerial view of Salvador. 

Salvador is divided into a number of distinct neighborhoods, with the most well known districts being Pelourinho , Comércio, and Old Downtown, all located in West Zone. Barra , with its Farol da Barra, beaches and which is where one of the Carnival circuits begins, Barra is home of the Portuguese Hospital and Spanish Hospital, the neighborhood is located in South Zone. Vitória , a neighborhood with many high rise buildings, is located in South Zone. Campo Grande , with its Dois de Julho Square and the monument to Bahia's independence, is also located in South Zone, as is Graça , an important residential area. Ondina , with Salvador's Zoobotanical Garden and the site where the Barra-Ondina Carnival circuit ends, the neighborhood is home of the Spanish Club, is also a neighborhood in the South Zone. 

Itaigara , Pituba , Horto Florestal, Caminho das Árvores , Loteamento Aquárius, Brotas , Stiep, Costa Azul, Armação, Jaguaribe and Stella Maris are the wealthiest and the New Downtown neighborhoods in the East Zone and the city.

[106] Pelourinho [ edit ] Main article: Historic Center (Salvador) UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Salvador de Bahia Name as inscribed on the World Heritage List Old houses in the historical center of Salvador. Type Cultural Criteria iv, vi Reference 309 UNESCO region Latin America and the Caribbean Inscription history Inscription 1985 (9th Session ) 

The Historic Center of Salvador was designated in 1985 a World Heritage Site by UNESCO . [6] The city represents a fine example the Portuguese urbanism from the middle of the 16th century with its higher administrative town and its lower commercial town, and a large portion of the city has retained the old character of its streets and colourful houses. 

As the first capital of Portuguese America , Salvador cultivated slave labor and had its pillories (" pelourinhos ") installed in open places like the Terreiro de Jesus and the squares know today as Tomé de Sousa and Castro Alves . The pillories were a symbol of authority and justice for some and of lashings and injustice for the majority. [107] The one erected for a short time in what is now the Historical Center, and later moved to what is now the Praça da Piedade (Square of Piety), ended up lending its name to the historical and architectural complex of Pelourinho , part of the city's upper town. 

Since 1992, the Pelourinho neighborhood has been subject to a nearly US$100 million " restoration " that has led to the rebuilding of hundreds of buildings' façades and the expulsion of the vast majority of the neighborhood's Afro-descendent population. This process has given rise to substantial political debate in the State of Bahia , since the Pelourinho's former residents have been for the most part excluded from the renovation's economic benefits (reaped by a few). A major restoration effort resulted in making the area a tourist attraction . [108] 

Salvador's considerable wealth and status during colonial times (as capital of the colony during 250 years and which gave rise to the Pelourinho) is reflected in the magnificence of its colonial palaces , churches and convents , most of them dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. These include: Cathedral of Salvador : Former Jesuit church of the city, built in the second half of the 17th century. Fine example of Mannerist architecture and decoration.

Mercado Modelo (Model Market): In 1861, at the Cayrú Square, the Customs Building was constructed, with a rotunda (large circular room with a domed ceiling) at the back end, where ships anchored to unload their merchandise. Lacerda Elevator ( Elevador Lacerda ): Inaugurated in 1873, this elevator was planned and built by the businessman Antônio Francisco de Lacerda, The four elevator cages connect the 72 metres (236 ft) between the Thomé de Souza Square in the upper city, and the Cayru Square in the lower city. In each run, which lasts for 22 seconds, the elevator transports 128 persons, 24 hours a day. Sports [ edit ] Pituaçu Stadium.

The present Church of Our Lady of Help is located a block away from the original site. [23] ^ This basilica was later rebuilt from 1656 to 1672. [24] ^ The development of the tramways and elevators, however, ended a long-running trade for porters and chairmen carrying people and goods up the steep staircase streets of the escarpment.

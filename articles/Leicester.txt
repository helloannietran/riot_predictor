Leicester ( i / ˈ l ɛ s t ər / LESS -tər ) [5] is a city and unitary authority area in the East Midlands of England , and the county town of Leicestershire . The city lies on the River Soar and at the edge of the National Forest . 

In the 2011 census the population of the City of Leicester unitary authority was approximately 330,000 making it the most populous municipality in the East Midlands region. The associated urban area is also the 11th most populous in England and the 13th most populous the United Kingdom . [6] 

Leicester is at the intersection of the north/south Midland Main Line and east/west Birmingham/Leicester/Cambridge CrossCountry railway lines and the confluence of the M1 / M69 motorways and the A6 / A46 trunk routes.

Name [ edit ] 

The name of Leicester is recorded in the 9th-century History of the Britons as Cair Lerion (whence Welsh Caerlŷr ), and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as Ligora-ceastre . In the Domesday Book of 1086, it is recorded as Ledecestre . [7] The first element of the name, Ligora or Legora , is explained as a Brittonic river name, in a suggestion going back to William Somner (1701) an earlier name of the River Soar , cognate with the name of the Loire . [8] [9] The second element of the name comes from the Latin castrum which is reflected in both Welsh cair and Anglo-Saxon ceastre . 

Based on the Welsh name (given as Kaerleir ), Geoffrey of Monmouth proposes a king Leir of Britain as an eponymous founder in his Historia Regum Britanniae (12th century). [10] History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Leicester and History of Leicestershire Prehistory [ edit ] 

Leicester is one of the oldest cities in England, with a history going back at least two millennia. [ citation needed ] The native Iron Age settlement encountered by the Romans at the site seems to have developed in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC . [ citation needed ] Little is known about this settlement or the condition of the River Soar at this time, although roundhouses from this era have been excavated and seem to have clustered along roughly 8 hectares (20 acres) of the east bank of the Soar above its confluence with the Trent . This area of the Soar was split into two channels: a main stream to the east and a narrower channel on the west, with a presumably marshy island between. The settlement seems to have controlled a ford across the larger channel. The later Roman name was a latinate form of the Brittonic word for "ramparts" (cf. Gaelic rath the nearby villages of Ratby and Ratcliffe [11] ), suggesting the site was an oppidum . The plural form of the name suggests it was initially composed of several villages. [11] The Celtic tribe holding the area was later recorded as the " Coritanians " but an inscription recovered in 1983 showed this to have been a corruption of the original " Corieltauvians ". [12] [13] The Corieltauvians are believed to have ruled over roughly the area of the East Midlands . Roman [ edit ] St Nicholas's Church and the Jewry Wall . Main article: Ratae Corieltauvorum 

It is believed that the Romans arrived in the Leicester area around AD 47, during their conquest of southern Britain . [14] The Corieltauvian settlement lay near a bridge on the Fosse Way , a Roman road between the legionary camps at Isca ( Exeter ) and Lindum ( Lincoln ). It remains unclear whether the Romans fortified and garrisoned the location, but it slowly developed from around the year 50 onwards as the tribal capital of the Corieltauvians under the name Ratae Corieltauvorum . In the 2nd century, it received a forum and bathhouse . In 2013, the discovery of a Roman cemetery found just outside the old city walls and dating back to AD 300 was announced. [14] The remains of the baths of Roman Leicester can be seen at the Jewry Wall ; recovered artifacts are displayed at the adjacent museum . Medieval [ edit ] 

Knowledge of the town following the Roman withdrawal from Britain is limited. Certainly there is some continuation of occupation of the town, though on a much reduced scale in the 5th and 6th centuries. Its memory was preserved as the Cair Lerion [15] of the History of the Britons . [16] Following the Saxon invasion of Britain , Leicester was occupied by the Middle Angles and subsequently administered by the kingdom of Mercia . It was elevated to a bishopric in either 679 or 680; this see survived until the 9th century, when Leicester was captured by Danish Vikings . Their settlement became one of the Five Burghs of the Danelaw , although this position was short-lived. The Saxon bishop, meanwhile, fled to Dorchester-on-Thames and Leicester did not become a bishopric again until the Church of St Martin became Leicester Cathedral in 1927. The settlement was recorded under the name Ligeraceaster in the early 10th century. [ citation needed ] Leicester Guildhall , dating from the 14th century 

Following the Norman conquest , Leicester was recorded by William 's Domesday Book as Ledecestre . It was noted as a city ( civitas ) but lost this status in the 11th century owing to power struggles between the Church and the aristocracy [ citation needed ] and did not become a legal city again until 1919. 

Geoffrey of Monmouth composed his History of the Kings of Britain around the year 1136, naming a King Leir as an eponymous founder figure. [17] According to Geoffrey's narrative, Cordelia had buried her father beneath the river in a chamber dedicated to Janus and that his feast day was an annual celebration. [18] 

During the C14th the earls of Leicester and Lancaster enhanced the prestige of the town. Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in the area to the south of the castle now known as The Newarke (the "new work"). Henry's son, the great Henry of Grosmont , 4th Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester, who was made first Duke of Lancaster, enlarged and enhanced his father's foundation, and built the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of The Newarke. [19] This church (a little of which survives in the basement of the Hawthorn Building of De Montfort University) was destroyed during the reign of King Edward VI. It became an important pilgrimage site because it housed a thorn said to be from the Crown of Thorns, given to the Duke by the King of France. The church (described by Leland in the C16th as "not large but exceeding fair") also became, effectively, a Lancastrian mausoleum. Duke Henry's daughter Blanche of Lancaster married John of Gaunt and their son Henry Bolingbroke became King Henry IV when he deposed King Richard II. The Church of the Annunciation was the burial place of Duke Henry, who had earlier had his father re-interred here. Later it became the burial place of Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster (second wife of John of Gaunt) and of Mary de Bohun , first wife of Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and mother of King Henry V (she did not become queen because she died before Bolingbroke became king). John of Gaunt died at Leicester Castle in 1399. When his son became king, the Earldom of Leicester and the Duchy of Lancaster became royal titles (and the latter remains so). The Newarke Gateway or Magazine Gateway. 

At the end of the War of the Roses , King Richard III was buried in Leicester's Greyfriars Church , whose ruins are now located beneath a car park. There was a legend that his corpse had been cast into the river , while some historians [20] argued that his tomb and remains were destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII . However, in September 2012, an archaeological investigation discovered a skeleton [21] which DNA testing helped verify to be related to two descendants of Richard III's sister. [22] In 2015 Richard III was reburied in pride of place near the high altar in Leicester Cathedral .

On 4 November 1530, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was arrested on charges of treason and taken from York Place . On his way south to face dubious justice at the Tower of London , he fell ill. The group escorting him was concerned enough to stop at Leicester. There, Wolsey's condition quickly worsened. He died on 29 November 1530 and was buried at Leicester Abbey , now Abbey Park . 

Lady Jane Grey , a great-granddaughter of Henry VII who reigned as England 's uncrowned Queen Regnant for nine days in June 1553, was born at Bradgate Park near Leicester around 1536. [23] 

Queen Elizabeth I 's intimate and former suitor, Robert Dudley , was given the Earldom of Leicester . Stuart [ edit ] 

The Corporation of Leicester opposed the efforts of Charles I of England to disafforest the nearby Leicester Forest , believing them to be likely to throw many of its residents into poverty and need of relief. Sir Miles Fleetwood was sent to commission the disafforestation and division of lands being used in common. [24] Riots destroyed enclosures in spring 1627 and 1628, following a pattern of anti-enclosure disturbances found elsewhere including the Western Rising. [25] 

Petitions challenging the enclosures were presented by the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents to the King and Privy Council . They were unsuccessful so petitioned the House of Lords in June 1628 who however supported Fleetwood but asked for proceedings made by the Crown against the rioters to be dropped. Compensation made to the legal residents of the forest was reasonably generous by comparison with other forests. The Corporation received 40 acres (16 ha) for relief of the poor. [26] Civil War [ edit ] 

Leicester was a Roundhead stronghold during the English Civil War . In 1645, Prince Rupert decided to attack the city to draw the New Model Army away from the Royalist headquarters of Oxford . Royalist guns were set up on Raw Dykes and, after an unsatisfactory response to a demand for surrender, the Newarke was stormed and the city was sacked on 30 May. Hundreds of people were killed by Rupert's cavalry and reports of the severity of the sacking were further exaggerated by the Parliamentary press in London. [27] Industrial era [ edit ] The Leicester Seamstress by James Walter Butler (1990) 

Leicester, Hotel Street 

The construction of the Grand Union Canal in the 1790s linked Leicester to London and Birmingham . In 1832, the railway arrived in Leicester. [ citation needed ] in the form of The Leicester and Swannington Railway which provided a supply of coal to the town from nearby collieries. The Midland Counties Railway (running from Derby to Rugby) linked the town to the national network by 1840. A direct link to London St Pancras Station was established by the Midland Railway in the 1860s. These developments encouraged and accompanied a process of industrialisation which intensified throughout the reign of Queen Victoria . Factories began to appear, particularly along the canal and river, and districts such as Frog Island and Woodgate were the locations of numerous large mills. Between 1861 and 1901, Leicester's population increased from 68 000 to 212 000 [ citation needed ] and the proportion employed in trade, commerce, building, and the city's new factories and workshops rose steadily. Hosiery, textiles, and footwear became the major industrial employers: manufacturers such as N. Corah Sons and the Cooperative Boot and Shoe Company were opening some of the largest manufacturing premises in Europe. They were joined, in the latter part of the century, by engineering firms such as Kent Street's Taylor Hubbard (crane makers founders [ clarification needed ] ), Vulcan Road's William Gimson Company (steam boilers founders), and Martin Street's Richards Company (steel works founders). 

The politics of Victorian Leicester were lively and very often bitter. Years of consistent economic growth meant that living standards generally increased, but Leicester was a stronghold of Radicalism . Thomas Cooper , the Chartist , kept a shop in Church Gate. There were serious Chartist riots in the town in 1842 and again six years later. [28] The Leicester Secular Society was founded in 1851 but secularist speakers such as George Holyoake were often denied the use of speaking halls. It was not until 1881 that Leicester Secular Hall was opened. The second half of the 19th century also witnessed the creation of many other institutions, including the town council, the Royal Infirmary, and the Leicester Constabulary. It also benefited from general acceptance [ citation needed ] that municipal organisations had a responsibility to provide for the town's water supply, drainage, and sanitation. 

Leicester became a county borough in 1889, although it was abolished with the rest in 1974 as part of the Local Government Act . The city regained its unitary status apart from Leicestershire in 1997. The borough had been expanding throughout the 19th century, but grew most notably when it annexed Belgrave , Aylestone , North Evington , Knighton , and Stoneygate in 1892. Early 20th century [ edit ] Edwardian Leicester 

In 1900, the Great Central Railway provided another link to London, but the rapid population growth of the previous decades had already begun to slow by the time of Queen Victoria's death in 1901. World War I and the subsequent epidemics had further impacts. Nonetheless, Leicester was finally recognised as a legal city once more in 1919 and, in 1927, again became a cathedral city on the consecration of St Martin's . A second major extension to the boundaries following the changes in 1892 took place in 1935, with the annexation of the remainder of Evington , Humberstone , Beaumont Leys , and part of Braunstone . A third major revision of the boundaries took place in 1966, with the net addition to the city of just over 450 acres (182 ha). The boundary has remained unchanged since that time.

Leicester's diversified economic base and lack of dependence on primary industries meant that it was much better placed than many other cities to weather the tariff wars of the 1920s and Great Depression of the 1930s. The Bureau of Statistics of the newly formed League of Nations identified Leicester in 1936 as the 2nd-richest city in Europe [29] and it became an attractive destination for refugees fleeing persecution and political turmoil in continental Europe . Firms such as Corah and Liberty Shoes used their reputation for producing high-quality products to expand their businesses. These years witnessed the growth in the city of trade unionism and particularly the co-operative movement . The Co-op became an important employer and landowner; when Leicester played host to the Jarrow March on its way to London in 1936, the Co-op provided the marchers with a change of boots. In 1938, Leicester was selected as the base for Squadron 1F, the first A.D.C.C (Air Defence Cadet Corp), the predecessor of the Air Training Corps .

The years after World War II , particularly from the 1960s onwards, brought many social and economic challenges. Urban expansion; central rapprochement [ edit ] 

Mass housebuilding continued across Leicester for some 30 years after 1945. Existing housing estates such as Braunstone were expanded, while several completely new estates – of both private and council tenure – were built. [ citation needed ] The last major development of this era was Beaumont Leys in the north of the city, which was developed in the 1970s as a mix of private and council housing. [ citation needed ] There was a steady decline in Leicester's traditional manufacturing industries and, in the city centre, working factories and light industrial premises have now been almost entirely replaced. Many former factories, including some on Frog Island and at Donisthorpe Mill , have been badly damaged by fire. Rail and barge were finally eclipsed by automotive transport in the 1960s and 1970s: the Great Central and the Leicester Swannington both closed and the northward extension of the M1 motorway linked Leicester into England's growing motorway network. With the loss of much of the city's industry during the 1970s and 1980s, some of the old industrial jobs were replaced by new jobs in the service sector, particularly in retail. The opening of the Haymarket Shopping Centre in 1971 was followed by a number of new shopping centres in the city, including St Martin's Shopping Centre in 1984 and the Shire Shopping Centre in 1992. [30] The Shires was subsequently expanded in September 2008 and rebranded as Highcross. [31] By the 1990s, as well, Leicester's central position and good transport links had established it as a distribution centre; the southwestern area of the city has also attracted new service and manufacturing businesses. Immigration [ edit ] 1972 advertisement in the Uganda Argus newspaper to discourage Ugandan Asians from settling in Leicester 

Since the war, Leicester has experienced large scale immigration from across the world. Many Polish servicemen were prevented from returning to their homeland after the war by the communist regime [ citation needed ] , and they established a small community in Leicester. Economic migrants from the Irish Republic continued to arrive throughout the post war period. Immigrants from the Indian sub-continent began to arrive in the 1960s, their numbers boosted by Asians arriving from Kenya and Uganda in the early 1970s. [32] [33] 

In 1972, Idi Amin announced that the entire Asian community in Uganda had 90 days to leave the country. [34] Shortly thereafter, the Leicester City Council launched a campaign aimed at dissuading Ugandan Asians from migrating to the city. [35] The ads did not have their intended effect, instead making more migrants aware of the possibility of settling in Leicester. [36] Nearly a quarter of initial Ugandan refugees (around 5000 to 6000) settled in Leicester, and by the end of the 1970s around another quarter of the initially dispersed refugees had made their way to Leicester. [37] Officially, the adverts were taken out for fear that immigrants to Leicester would place pressure on city services and at least one person who was a city councillor at the time says that he believes they were placed for racist reasons. [38] The initial advertisement was widely condemned, and taken as a marker of anti-Asian sentiment throughout Britain as a whole, although the attitudes that resulted in the initial advertisement were changed significantly in subsequent decades. [39] Recent Leicester councillors have expressed significant regret for the council having run the advertisement. [38] 

In the 1990s, a group of Dutch citizens of Somali origin settled in the city. Since the 2004 enlargement of the European Union a significant number of East European migrants have settled in the city. While some wards in the northeast of the city are more than 70% South Asia , wards in the west and south are all over 70% white. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) had estimated that by 2011 Leicester would have approximately a 50% ethnic minority population, making it the first city in Britain not to have a white British majority. [40] This prediction was based on the growth of the ethnic minority populations between 1991 (Census 1991 28% ethnic minority) and 2001 (Census 2001 – 36% ethnic minority). However Professor Ludi Simpson at the University of Manchester School of Social Sciences said in September 2007 that the CRE had "made unsubstantiated claims and ignored government statistics" and that Leicester's immigrant and minority communities disperse to other places. [41] [42] [43] 

The Leicester Multicultural Advisory Group [44] is a forum, set up in 2001 by the editor of the Leicester Mercury , to co-ordinate community relations with members representing the council, police, schools, community and faith groups, and the media.

The Office for National Statistics has defined a Leicester Urban Area , which consists of the conurbation of Leicester, although it has no administrative status. The area contains the unitary authority area and several towns, villages and suburbs outside the city's administrative boundaries. Climate [ edit ] 

Leicester experiences a maritime climate with mild to warm summers and cool winters, rain spread throughout the year, and low sunshine levels. The nearest official Weather Station was Newtown Linford, about 5 miles (8.0 km) northwest of Leicester city centre and just outside the edge of the urban area. However, observations stopped there in 2003. [ citation needed ] The current nearest weather station is Market Bosworth, about 10 miles (16 km) west of the city centre. [ citation needed ] 

The highest temperature recorded at Newtown Linford was 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) during August 1990, [45] although a temperature of 35.1 °C (95.2 °F) was achieved at Leicester University during August 2003. [46] More typically the highest temperature would reach 28.7 °C (83.7 °F) – the average annual maximum. [47] 11.3 °C (52.3 °F) days of the year should attain a temperature of 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or above. [48] 

The lowest temperature recorded at Newtown Linford was −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) during January 1963. [49] Typically, 54.9 air frosts will be recorded during the course of the year. 

Rainfall averages 684.4 mm per year, [50] with 1 mm or more falling on 120.8 days. [51] All averages refer to the period 1971–2000. Climate data for Newtown Linford, elevation 119 m, 1971–2000, extremes 1960–2003 Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 13.6

On 1 April 1997, Leicester City Council became a unitary authority . Before then, local government was a two-tier system: the city and county councils were responsible for different aspects of local government services: this system is still in place in the rest of Leicestershire. Leicestershire County Council retained its headquarters at County Hall in Glenfield , just outside the city boundary but within the urban area. The administrative offices of Leicester City Council are in the centre of the city at 115 Charles Street, having moved from Welford Place, to be developed into a complex of offices and plazas. Some services (particularly the police and the ambulance service) still cover the whole of the city and county/ies, but for the most part the councils are independent. 

After a long period of Labour administration (since 1979), the city council from May 2003 was run by a Liberal Democrat / Conservative coalition under Roger Blackmore , which collapsed in November 2004. The minority Labour group ran the city until May 2005, under Ross Willmott, when the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives formed a new coalition, again under the leadership of Roger Blackmore. 

In the local government elections of 3 May 2007, Leicester's Labour Party once again took control of the council in what can be described as a landslide victory . Gaining 18 new councillors, Labour polled on the day 38 councillors, creating a governing majority of +20. Significantly however, the Green Party gained its first councillors in the Castle Ward, after losing on the drawing of lots in 2003, though one of these subsequently resigned and the seat was lost to Labour in a by-election on 10 September 2009. [53] The Conservative Party saw a decrease in their representation. The Liberal Democrat Party was the major loser, dropping from 25 councillors in 2003 to only 6 in 2007. 

In the local government elections of 5 May 2011, Labour won 52 of the city's 54 seats, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats winning one seat each. [54] 

Leicester is divided into three Parliamentary constituencies, all controlled by the Labour Party : Leicester East , represented by Keith Vaz , Leicester South , represented by Jon Ashworth , and Leicester West represented by Liz Kendall . In April 2011 the then Leicester South MP Sir Peter Soulsby left the House of Commons to seek election as Mayor of Leicester. 

On 5 May 2011, Peter Soulsby became the first directly elected Mayor of Leicester . 

Before the creation of an elected executive Mayor the post of civic mayor and later Lord Mayor existed. The first mayor of Leicester was a Norman knight, Peter fitz Roger ("Peter, son of Roger") in 1251. [55] [56] Following the restoration of city status this title was elevated to "Lord Mayor." In 1987 the first Asian Mayor of Leicester was indirectly elected by the councillors, Councillor Gordhan Parmar. [57] After institution of a directly elected mayor in 2011 the Lord Mayor of Leicester still exists as a ceremonial role under Leicester City Council . [58] Coat of arms [ edit ] 

The Corporation of Leicester's coat of arms was first granted to the city at the Heraldic Visitation of 1619, and is based on the arms of the first Earl of Leicester , Robert Beaumont. The charge is a cinquefoil 'ermine', on a red field, and this emblem is used by the city council. 

After Leicester became a city again in 1919, the city council applied to add to the arms. Permission for this was granted in 1929, when the supporting lions, from the Lancastrian Earls of Leicester, were added. 

The motto "Semper Eadem" was the motto of Queen Elizabeth I , who granted a royal charter to the city. It means "always the same" but with positive overtones meaning unchanging, reliable or dependable. The crest on top of the arms is a white or silver legless wyvern with red and white wounds showing, on a wreath of red and white. The legless wyvern distinguishes it as a Leicester wyvern as opposed to other wyverns. The supporting lions are wearing coronets in the form of collars, with the white cinquefoil hanging from them. Demography [ edit ] Main article: Demography of Leicester Demographic comparatives [ edit ] 

In the 2011 census, the population of the Leicester unitary authority was 329,839, an increase of 11.8% compared to the United Kingdom Census 2001 figure of 279,921. The wider Leicester Urban Area , [59] showed an estimated population of 509,000. The population of the Leicester unitary authority is marginally higher than that of Nottingham, while Nottingham has a higher urban area population compared to that of Leicester. Eurostat 's Larger Urban Zone listed the population of the Leicester LUZ at 836,484 (2011) just above that of their East Midland neighbour; metropolitan and city region populations tend to be similar. According to the 2011 census Leicester had the largest proportion of people aged 19-and-under in the East Midlands at 27 per cent. Coventry, to the south west, has population close to that of Leicester although the urban and LUZ populations of Coventry are lower given the proximity to Birmingham. 

The Eurostat regional yearbook 2015 classifies Leicester as one of country's eleven 'Greater Cities', together with Birmingham and Nottingham in the Midlands.

In addition, 0.6% belonged to other religions, 22.8% identified with no religion and 5.6% did not respond to the question. [62] There are three active synagogues in the city: one Progressive, one Orthodox, and one Messianic. 

Leicester is the second fastest growing city in the country. [63] Languages [ edit ] 

A demographic profile of Leicester published by the city council in 2008 noted: 

Alongside English, around 70 languages and/or dialects spoken in the city. In addition to English and the primary western and central european languages, eight ethnic languages are sometimes heard: Gujarati is the preferred language of 16% of the city's residents, Punjabi 3%, Somali 4% and Urdu 2%. Other smaller language groups include Hindi , Bengali . With continuing migration into the city, new languages and or dialects from Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe are also being spoken in the city. 

In certain primary schools in Leicester, English may not be the preferred language of 45% of pupils and the proportion of children whose first language is known, or believed to be, other than English, is significantly higher than other cities in the Midlands or the UK as a whole.

Henry Walker was a successful pork butcher who moved from Mansfield to Leicester in the 1880s to take over an established business in High Street. The first Walker's crisp production line was in the empty upper storey of Walker's Oxford Street factory in Leicester. In the early days the potatoes were sliced up by hand and cooked in an ordinary fish and chip fryer. In 1971 the Walker's crisps business was sold to Standard Brands , an American firm, who sold on the company to Frito-Lay . Walker's crisps currently makes 10 million bags of crisps per day at two factories in Beaumont Leys, and is the UK's largest grocery brand. [71] The Beaumont Leys manufacturing plant is the largest crisp factory in the world. [72] 

Meanwhile, the sausage and pie business was bought out by Samworth Brothers in 1986. Production outgrew the Cobden Street site and pork pies are now manufactured at a meat processing factory and bakery in Beaumont Leys, coincidentally situated near the separately owned crisp factories. Sold under the Walker's name and under UK retailers own brands such as Tesco Finest, over three million hot and cold pies are made each week. [73] Henry Walker's butcher shop at 4–6 Cheapside sold Walker's sausages and pork pies until March 2012 when owner Scottish Fife Fine Foods went bust, although the shop is temporarily open and selling Walker's pies for the Christmas 2012 season.

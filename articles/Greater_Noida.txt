Greater Noida ( Hindi :ग्रेटर नोएडा) is a north Indian city with a population in excess of 100,000, located in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh . [2] It comes under the purview of the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. Situated 30 km south-east of capital city of New Delhi , it takes around 30 minutes to travel between the cities via the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway . [3]

History [ edit ] 

In the early 1980s, the government of India realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos, so they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida, there were two areas that had been developed— Gurgaon , across the border from Haryana , and Noida , across the border with Uttar Pradesh. Bisrakh , Uttar Pradesh ; the birthplace of Demon king Ravana [4] 

Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the Indian economy . Migration to cities like Delhi, Mumbai , Kolkata, Chennai , and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20–25 years. The massive population influx to Delhi , however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although intake is not complete and illegal mining remains a problem. [5] Shaheed Bismil Park , Sector-Beta 1 in Greater Noida 

The government of Uttar Pradesh decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better planning . The idea was to create a world-class city approximately 25 km from Noida. A railway station near Boraki and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city; the airport was however scrapped in early 2012, owing to environmental concerns. [6] [7] 

During the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of Gautam Buddh Nagar ) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The development of the city is managed by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). [8] Greater Noida is connected to Agra by the six-lane Yamuna Expressway . The annual Indian Grand Prix is held at the Buddh International Circuit . Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the Greek alphabet . All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the Mainpuri conspiracy. A park has been named "Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan" by the Uttar Pradesh Government. [9] 

The 12th and 14th Auto Expos (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014 and 2016 respectively. Greater Noida West [ edit ] 

Greater Noida West, previously known as Noida extension, is a part of Greater Noida and consists of 16 villages: Shahberi, Devla , Patwari , Ghanghola, Bisrakh , Roza-Yakubpur , Haibatpur , Itaida , Patwari, Noida , Aminabad , Khairpur Gujjar , Asadallapur , Maincha and Chipyana Buzurg . [10] [11] All sectors under Noida Extension (Sector 1 to 4) are very much a part of the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). [12] 

As of late 2012, plans were being formed to rename it to Greater Noida (West). Planners intended the area to provide NCR region housing. [13] Demographics [ edit ] 

As per provisional data of the 2011 census, Greater Noida had a population of 107,676, with 58,662 males and 49,014 females. The literacy rate was 86.54%, 91.48% of males and 80.65% of females. [14] The demographics of Greater Noida mainly consist of students, corporate employees, and labourers. Students are often temporary residents from other parts of India and abroad. Greater Noida and Noida combined have 200 aprox villages, out of which 110 have a Gurjar majority and 50 villages have yadav as a majority. [ citation needed ] Climate [ edit ] 

Greater Noida has a similar climate to Delhi: very hot and dry during summer, hot and humid during monsoons, pleasant and dry during spring and autumn, and cool to cold during winters. 

According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-III, on a scale of I to V (in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) while the wind and cyclone zoning is a "very high damage risk", according to the UNDP report. Greater Noida has a Tropical Savanna Climate with three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Aside from monsoon weather, it mainly remains dry. 

In summer, i.e. from March to June, the temperature ranges from a maximum of 45 °C (i.e. 113 °F) to a minimum of 23 °C (73 °F). Monsoon season prevails during mid-June to mid-September with an average rainfall of 93.2 cm (36.7 inches). The cold waves from the Himalayan region make the winters in Greater Noida very chilly. Temperatures fall down to as low as 3 to 4 °C at the peak of winter. In January, a dense fog envelopes the city, reducing visibility on the streets.

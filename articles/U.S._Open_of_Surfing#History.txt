The U.S. Open of Surfing is a week-long surfing competition held annually during the summer in Huntington Beach, California . Generally held on the south side of the Huntington Beach Pier , the U.S. Open is part of the qualification process for the World Surf League and is a WSL QS 10,000 event. [1] [2] It is the largest surfing competition in the world. [3] It has been owned by IMG since 2000. [4] [5] 

As part of the event, notable people in the world of surfing are added to the Surfing Walk of Fame and to the Surfers' Hall of Fame, both directly across from the pier.

History [ edit ] 

The U.S. Open, then called the West Coast Surfing Championship, was first held in 1959. In 1964 it became known as the United States Surfing Championships. In 1982 it became known as the OP Pro for its sponsor, Ocean Pacific . The event was renamed the U.S. Open of Surfing in 1994. [6] 

The contest was traditionally held during Labor Day weekend. The event was changed to an earlier date following the 1986 event when riots occurred at the OP Pro. [7] 

Rioting again marred the 2013 U.S. Open. On the final day of the event, as the crowds left the contest area and filled Main Street, a civil disturbance erupted, resulting in property damage and several arrests and some injuries. [8] As a result, the event owner IMG stated that in 2014 it will discontinue events such as free concerts and focus more on the sport. [9] 

Spending at the nine-day event adds $21.5 million to the Orange County economy and $16.4 million in Huntington Beach. [2] It is attended by nearly 500,000 people. [10] Champions [ edit ] West Coast Surfing Champions [ edit ]

(October 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The Leader of the Luddites , engraving of 1812 

Luddites were 19th-century English textile workers (or self-employed weavers who feared the end of their trade) who protested against newly developed technologies that required fewer skilled workers, primarily between 1811 and 1816. The stocking frames , spinning frames and power looms introduced during the Industrial Revolution threatened to replace them with less-skilled, low-wage labourers, leaving them without work. The Luddite movement culminated in a region-wide rebellion in Northwestern England that required a massive deployment of military force to suppress. 

As a result of this group, the term has since developed a secondary meaning: a "Luddite" is one opposed to industrialisation , automation , computerisation or new technologies in general. [1]

Etymology [ edit ] 

Although the origin of the name Luddite ( / ˈ l ʌ d . aɪ t / ) is uncertain, a popular belief is that the movement was named after Ned Ludd , a youth who allegedly smashed two stocking frames in 1779, and whose name had become emblematic of machine destroyers. [2] [3] [4] The name evolved into the imaginary General Ludd or King Ludd , who, like Robin Hood , was reputed to live in Sherwood Forest . [5] [a] Background [ edit ] 

The majority of lower classes were not disloyal to the King or government, but were instead largely disenfranchised. [ citation needed ] The working class of the eighteenth century never tried to alter the Constitution, and never openly desired a change in the form of administration. [8] Protests and demonstrations occurred only when the public continued to be exploited by the government and suffer from raised prices. Overall, violent action was rare, as the majority of individuals were primarily concerned with meeting their own daily needs. When these needs were not met, the frequent violent events within the century occurred. [9] 

The movement can be seen as part of a rise in English working-class discontent in the late 18th and early 19th century. An agricultural variant of Luddism, centering on the breaking of threshing machines, occurred during the widespread Swing Riots of 1830 in southern and eastern England. [10] [b] The Luddites' goal was to gain a better bargaining position with their employers, not to eliminate technology out of fear as they are frequently mislabeled. [14] 

Irregular rises in food prices provoked Keelmen in the port of Tyne to riot in 1710 [15] and tin miners to steal from granaries at Falmouth in 1727. There was a rebellion in Northumberland and Durham in 1740, and manhandling of Quaker corn dealers in 1756. More peaceably, skilled artisans in the cloth, building, shipbuilding, printing and cutlery trades organised friendly societies to insure themselves against unemployment, sickness, and in some cases against intrusion of "foreign" labour into their trades, as was common among guilds. [16] [c] History [ edit ] 

The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic Wars , which saw a rise in difficult working conditions in the new textile factories. Luddites objected primarily to the rising popularity of automated textile equipment, threatening the jobs and livelihoods of skilled workers as this technology allowed them to be replaced by cheaper and less skilled workers. [17] The movement began in Arnold , Nottingham on 11 March 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years. [18] [19] Handloom weavers burned mills and pieces of factory machinery. 

Textile workers destroyed industrial equipment during the late 18th century, [17] prompting acts such as the Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788 . 

The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns, where they would practice drills and maneuvers. Their main areas of operation were Nottinghamshire in November 1811, followed by the West Riding of Yorkshire in early 1812 and Lancashire by March 1813. [ citation needed ] Luddites battled the British Army at Burton's Mill in Middleton and at Westhoughton Mill , both in Lancashire. [20] Rumours abounded at the time that local magistrates employed agents provocateurs to instigate the attacks. [ citation needed ] Using the pseudonym King Ludd , the Luddites and their supporters anonymously sent death threats to, and possibly attacked, magistrates and food merchants. Activists smashed Heathcote's lacemaking machine in Loughborough in 1816. [21] He and other industrialists had secret chambers constructed in their buildings that could be used as hiding places during an attack. [22] 

In 1817, an unemployed Nottingham stockinger and probably ex-Luddite named Jeremiah Brandreth led the Pentrich Rising , which was a general uprising unrelated to machinery, but which could be viewed as the last major Luddite act. [ citation needed ] Government response [ edit ] Later interpretation of machine breaking (1812), showing two men superimposed on an 1844 engraving from the Penny magazine which shows a post 1820s Jacquard loom . [d] Machine-breaking was criminalised by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as early as 1721, the penalty being penal transportation , but as a result of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame Breaking Act 1812 made the death penalty available: see " criminal damage in English law ". 

The British Army clashed with the Luddites on several occasions, and at one time more British soldiers were fighting the Luddites than were fighting Napoleon on the Iberian Peninsula . [23] [e] Three Luddites, led by George Mellor, ambushed and assassinated a mill owner named William Horsfall from Ottiwells Mill in Marsden, West Yorkshire at Crosland Moor in Huddersfield . Horsfall had remarked that he would "Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood." Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall's groin, and all three men were arrested. 

The British government sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at York in January 1813, following the attack on Cartwrights mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton. The government charged over sixty men, including Mellor and his companions, with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities. While some of those charged were actual Luddites, many had no connection to the movement. Although the proceedings were legitimate jury trials (many were abandoned due to lack of evidence and 30 men were acquited), they were certainly intended to act as show trials , intended to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities. The harsh sentences meted out, which included execution and penal transportation , quickly ended the movement. [24] [25] 

Parliament subsequently made "machine breaking" (i.e. industrial sabotage ) a capital crime with the Frame Breaking Act [26] and the Malicious Damage Act 1861 . [27] Lord Byron opposed this legislation, becoming one of the few prominent defenders of the Luddites after the treatment of the defendants at the York trials. [ citation needed ] 

Several decades later, in 1867, Karl Marx referred to the Luddites in Capital, Volume I , noting that it would be some time before workers were able to distinguish between the machines and "the form of society which utilises these instruments" and their ideas "The instrument of labour, when it takes the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself." [28] In retrospect [ edit ] 

In the 19th century, occupations that arose out of the growth of trade and shipping in ports, but also in 'domestic' manufacturers, the dramatic growth industries of those years, were notorious for precarious employment prospects. Underemployment was chronic during this period, [16] and it was common practice to retain a larger workforce than was normally needed as an insurance against labour shortages in boom times. [16] 

Moreover, the organization of manufacture by merchant-capitalists in the textile industry was inherently unstable. Whilst the financiers' capital was still largely invested in raw material, it was easy to increase commitment where trade was good, and almost as easy to cut back when times were bad. Merchant-capitalists lacked the incentive of later factory owners, whose capital was invested in building and plants, to maintain a steady rate of production and return on fixed capital. Combined with seasonal variations in wage rates and violent short-term fluctuations springing from harvests and war, periodic outbreaks of violence are more easily understood. [16] Modern usage [ edit ] 

In 1956, a speech in Parliament said that "organised workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy". [29] More recently, the term Neo-Luddism has emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology. [30] According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress (April 1996; Barnesville, Ohio), Neo-Luddism is "a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age." [31] 

The term Luddite fallacy is used by economists in reference to the fear that technological unemployment inevitably generates structural unemployment (and is consequently macroeconomically injurious). If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs. [32] See also [ edit ] Development criticism Simple living Technophobia Turner Controversy – return to pre-industrial methods of production Notes [ edit ] ^ Historian Eric Hobsbawm has called their machine wrecking " collective bargaining by riot", which had been a tactic used in Britain since the Restoration , as the scattering of manufactories throughout the country made large-scale strikes impractical. [6] [7] ^ Research by Kevin Binfield and other researchers asserts that, since organised action by stockingers had occurred at various times since 1675, the movements of the early 19th century must be viewed in the context of the hardships suffered by the working class during the Napoleonic Wars, rather than as an absolute aversion to machinery. [11] [12] [13] Malcolm L. Thomis argued in his 1970 history, "The Luddites," that without the structure of a union, machine-breaking was one of the only mechanisms workers could use to increase pressure on employers, to undermine lower-paid competing workers, and to create solidarity among workers, "These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made." [13] ^ The Falmouth magistrates reported to the Duke of Newcastle (16 Nov. 1727) that "the unruly tinners" had "broke open and plundered several cellars and granaries of corn". Their report concludes with a comment that suggests that they were no more able than some modern historians to understand the rationale of the direct action of the tinners: "the occasion of these outrages was pretended by the rioters to be a scarcity of corn in the county, but this suggestion is probably false, as most of those who carried off the corn gave it away or sold it at quarter price". PRO, SP 36/4/22. ^ The Penny Magazine 1844, p.33 ^ Hobsbawm has popularized this comparison and refers to the original statement in Frank Ongley Darvall (1969) Popular Disturbances and Public Order in Regency England , London, Oxford University Press, page 260.

The Snow Riot was a riot and lynch mob in Washington, D.C. in August 1835. [1] An attack on free blacks in the city by whites, the Snow Riot wreaked havoc on anything affiliated with free blacks for days by robbing and destroying all of their establishments. The name of the riot comes from the first destination the mob attacked, the restaurant owned by free black, Mr. Beverly Snow's Epicurean Eating House. After attacking Snow's restaurant, the mob went and destroyed the school Arthur Bowen went to. The mob attacked the school because Bowen was suspected of being taught of abolishing slavery at this school. The larger context of the attack on the school was the white working-class men's frustration over free blacks ability to work, and their resentment of black competition for jobs. The clear result was the unleashing of white terror against blacks. The riot continued for days in the nation's capital, and it was not until President Andrew Jackson intervened that it stopped.

History [ edit ] 

The Snow Riot was a critical event that occurred 25 years before The American Civil War . The Riot occurred in 1835, and the war between the North and the Confederate South took place in 1861. In 1835, the city of Washington was facing unprecedented tension between abolitionists and slavery defenders. The tension was so high because the largest amount of fatalities caused by a slave uprising occurred only a few years prior to the Snow Riot, the Nat Turner's slave rebellion of 1831 . Ever since this rebellion led by Nat Turner, widespread panic and fear spread across the States. Because of this panic, there were abolitionists flooding the city with extremely loud voices and protests for the removal of slaves in the nation's capital. However, there were also a significant number of whites waiting for their moment to revenge the slave's uprising of 1831. The event that sparked the riots of Mr. Beverly Snow in 1835 was when an inebriated slave, Arthur Bowen, came into his Mistress Anna Thorton's bedroom with an ax. [3] Bowen did not strike or attempt to strike his Mistress. However, the sheer fact that a slave had the opportunity to rebel against slave owners and whites infuriated slavery defenders in the city. Bowen was ultimately taken into custody without harm as this gave Proslavery advocates an opportunity to go after the man leading the production and distribution of abolitionist material, Reuben Crandall. District Attorney Francis Scott Key , writer of the United States' national anthem , The Star-Spangled Banner , was the leading man behind coordinating the arrest of Crandall. This arrest of Crandall sparked a huge mob of whites in the Capital, attacking all establishments run by free blacks: schools, churches and businesses. The first destination the mob attacked was the Epicurean Eating House, [4] a restaurant owned by Mr. Beverly Snow, a free black in the city. His restaurant was known in the city for serving very sophisticated and luxurious food, but it was ransacked to ruins by the mob in search of Snow because he was a free black owner. The mob searched for Snow, but were unable to find and capture him. Background of Beverly Snow [ edit ] 

A free black who lived in Washington, D.C. Snow was different than most free blacks, as he was extremely educated, wealthy, successful, and "perhaps even a bit snobbish". Beverly Snow was one of a number of black entrepreneurs who owned businesses in the downtown area. His success was evidence of the strength of Washington's free black population. He was the owner of a restaurant named the Epicurean Eating House in D.C. that was located on the corner of 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. The Epicurean Eating House was the site of a riot in 1835, popularly known as the Snow Riot. References [ edit ] ^ "Password Logon Page" . find.galegroup.com .

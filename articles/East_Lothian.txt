East Lothian ( Scots : Aest Lowden , Scottish Gaelic : Lodainn an Ear ), is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland , and a lieutenancy area . For a time, it was also known as Haddingtonshire . 

It borders the City of Edinburgh , Midlothian and the Scottish Borders . Its administrative centre is Haddington , although its largest town is Musselburgh . East Lothian is also the name of a registration county , which has different boundaries to the council area. [1] 

The council area was created in 1996, replacing the East Lothian district of the Lothian region . The district had been created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 , consisting of the old county of East Lothian plus the burgh of Musselburgh and the parish of Inveresk (which included Wallyford and Whitecraig ) which until then had been in the county of Midlothian. 

When abolished, for local government purposes, in 1975, the county of East Lothian bordered the county of Midlothian to the west, and Berwickshire to the south.

East Lothian is served by two local paid-for weekly newspapers, the East Lothian Courier and the East Lothian News . The former, known locally as The Courier , is the better-selling and started in 1859 as the Haddingtonshire Courier (the name was changed in 1971). The family firm of D. J. Croal, based in Haddington, owned and operated the paper until it was bought by the Dunfermline Press Group in 2004. The East Lothian News was first published in 1971, as part of Scottish County Press group, with editorial offices in Dalkeith and printing at Bonnyrigg (both in Midlothian ). SCP was acquired by Regional Independent Media in 2000, which was in turn bought by Johnston Press in 2002.

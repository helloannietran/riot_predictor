Cleveland ( / ˈ k l iː v l ən d / KLEEV -lənd ) is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County , [7] the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie , approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River , and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare , and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 

As of the 2013 Census Estimate , the city proper had a total population of 390,113, making Cleveland the 48th largest city in the United States, [5] and the second-largest city in Ohio after Columbus . [8] [9] Greater Cleveland , the Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area , ranked 29th largest in the United States, and second largest in Ohio after Cincinnati with 2,064,725 people in 2013. [10] Cleveland is part of the larger Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area , which in 2013 had a population of 3,501,538, and ranked as the country's 15th largest CSA . [10] Residents of Cleveland are called " Clevelanders ". Cleveland has many nicknames, the oldest of which in contemporary use being " The Forest City ". [11]

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Cleveland See also: Timeline of Cleveland history 

Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company laid out Connecticut 's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland . Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square , before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter , who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. [9] In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal . This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River . Growth continued with added railroad links. [12] Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836. [9] 

In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two. [13] Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854. [9] Bird's-eye view of Cleveland in 1877 

The city's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination point for iron ore shipped from Minnesota , along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland, and moved its headquarters to New York City in 1885. [14] Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as an important American manufacturing center, which included automotive companies such as Peerless , People's, [15] Jordan , Chandler , and Winton , maker of the first car driven across the U.S. [16] Other manufacturers located in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth , as well as the electric car company Baker . Because of the significant growth, Cleveland was known as the "Sixth City" during this period. [17] [18] 

By 1920, due in large part to the city's economic prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city . [9] The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. Many prominent Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic Lake View Cemetery , including President James A. Garfield , [19] and John D. Rockefeller. 

In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression , it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. [20] The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport , among others. [21] Following World War II , the city experienced a prosperous economy. In sports, the Indians won the 1948 World Series and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s. Businesses proclaimed that Cleveland was the "best location in the nation". [22] [23] [24] In 1940, non-Hispanic whites represented 90.2% of Cleveland's population. [25] The city's population reached its peak of 914,808, and in 1949 Cleveland was named an All-America City for the first time. [26] By the 1960s, the economy slowed, and residents sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of urban flight and suburban growth. [27] The Cuyahoga River winds through the Flats in a December 1937 aerial view of downtown Cleveland . 

In the 1950s and 1960s, social and racial unrest occurred in Cleveland, resulting in the Hough Riots from July 18 to 23, 1966 and the Glenville Shootout from July 23 to 25, 1968. In November 1967, Cleveland became the first major American city to elect a black mayor, Carl Stokes (who served from 1968 to 1971). 

Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city. This, along with the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew negative national press. As a result, Cleveland was often derided as "The Mistake on the Lake". [28] 

In December 1978, Cleveland became the first major American city to enter into a financial default on federal loans since the Great Depression. [9] By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation and the Savings and Loans Crisis contributed to the recession that impacted cities like Cleveland. [29] While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, [30] Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several production centers. [31] [32] [33] 

The metropolitan area began a gradual economic recovery under mayors George Voinovich and Michael R. White . Redevelopment within the city limits has been strongest in the downtown area near the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex —consisting of Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena —and near North Coast Harbor , including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, FirstEnergy Stadium , and the Great Lakes Science Center. Cleveland has been hailed by local media as the "Comeback City", [34] while economic development of the inner-city neighborhoods and improvement of the school systems are municipal priorities. [35] In 1999, Cleveland was identified as an emerging global city . [36] 

In the 21st century, the city has improved infrastructure, is more diversified, and has invested in the arts. Cleveland is generally considered an example of revitalization. The city's goals include additional neighborhood revitalization and increased funding for public education . [37] In 2009, it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to host the 2014 Gay Games , the fourth city in the United States to host this international event. [38] On July 8, 2014, it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to be the host city of the 2016 Republican National Convention . [39] Geography [ edit ] Topography [ edit ] 

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 82.47 square miles (213.60 km 2 ), of which 77.70 square miles (201.24 km 2 ) is land and 4.77 square miles (12.35 km 2 ) is water. [2] The shore of Lake Erie is 569 feet (173 m) above sea level ; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly perpendicular to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River , Big Creek, and Euclid Creek. The land rises quickly from the lakeshore. Public Square , less than one mile (1.6 km) inland, sits at an elevation of 650 feet (198 m), and Hopkins Airport, 5 miles (8 km) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 791 feet (241 m).

Cleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse , the Cleveland Public Library , and Public Auditorium , are clustered around an open mall and share a common neoclassical architecture . Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan , and constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States. [41] The Terminal Tower , dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. [42] It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square , combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Another of Cleveland's architectural treasures is The Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel. [43] Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont , along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches. [44] Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue , which was known for its prestige and elegance. In the late 1880s, writer Bayard Taylor described it as "the most beautiful street in the world". [45] Known as "Millionaire's Row", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such internationally known names as Rockefeller , Hanna , and Hay . [46] Neighborhoods [ edit ] The west bank of the Flats and the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland 

Downtown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District , which is home to Playhouse Square Center . Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums , lofts , and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project , and the developments along East 4th Street. [47] [48] Cleveland residents geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River . [49] The east side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye-Shaker , Central , Collinwood , Corlett, Euclid-Green, Fairfax , Forest Hills, Glenville , Payne/Goodrich-Kirtland Park, Hough , Kinsman, Lee Harvard/Seville-Miles , Mount Pleasant, Nottingham , St. Clair-Superior , Union-Miles Park, University Circle , Little Italy , and Woodland Hills . The west side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre , Clark-Fulton , Detroit-Shoreway , Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City , Tremont , Old Brooklyn , Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park : Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Puritas-Longmead, and Riverside. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley /Duck Island, Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont. Map of villages and other land annexed to the City of Cleveland 

Several inner-city neighborhoods have begun to gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been successful in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. [50] Furthermore, a live-work zoning overlay for the city's near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists. [51] NASA photograph of Cleveland and its surrounding suburbs Suburbs [ edit ] Main article: Greater Cleveland 

Cleveland's older, inner-ring suburbs include Bedford , Bedford Heights , Brook Park , Brooklyn , Brooklyn Heights , Cleveland Heights , Cuyahoga Heights , East Cleveland , Euclid , Fairview Park , Garfield Heights , Lakewood , Linndale , Maple Heights , Newburgh Heights , Parma , Parma Heights , Shaker Heights , Solon , South Euclid , University Heights , and Warrensville Heights . Many are members of the Northeast Ohio First Suburbs Consortium. [52] Climate [ edit ] 

Typical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a continental climate with four distinct seasons, which lies in the humid continental ( Köppen Dfa ) [53] zone. Summers are warm to hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky , but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached 100 inches (254 cm) of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893, [54] seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100 inches (254 cm) are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the ' Snow Belt ' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as Buffalo . [55] 

The all-time record high in Cleveland of 104 °F (40 °C) was established on June 25, 1988, [56] and the all-time record low of −20 °F (−29 °C) was set on January 19, 1994. [57] On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 73.5 °F (23.1 °C), and January, with a mean temperature of 28.1 °F (−2.2 °C), is the coldest. Normal yearly precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is 39.1 inches (990 mm). [58] The least precipitation occurs on the western side and directly along the lake, and the most occurs in the eastern suburbs. Parts of Geauga County to the east receive over 44 inches (1,100 mm) of liquid precipitation annually. [59] Frequent thunderstorms are also common in Cleveland especially during spring and early summer.

Known locally as the "Emerald Necklace", the Olmsted -inspired Metroparks encircle Cuyahoga county. Included in the system is the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo . Located in Big Creek valley, the zoo contains one of the largest collection of primates in North America. [140] In addition to the Metroparks system, the Cleveland Lakefront State Park district provides public access to Lake Erie. [141] This cooperative between the City of Cleveland and the State of Ohio contains six parks: Edgewater Park, located on the city's near west side between the Shoreway and the lake; East 55th Street Marina, Euclid Beach Park and Gordon Park . The Cleveland Public Parks District is the municipal body that oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic Rockefeller Park , notable for its late-19th century historical landmark bridges and Cultural Gardens .

Cleveland's position as a center of manufacturing established it as a hotbed of union activity early in its history. While other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, have historically supported the Republican Party , Cleveland commonly breeds the strongest support in the state for the Democrats . [143] At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government. Cleveland is split between two congressional districts . Most of the western part of the city is in the 9th District , represented by Marcy Kaptur . Most of the eastern part of the city, as well as most of downtown, is in the 11th District , represented by Marcia Fudge . Both are Democrats. 

During the 2004 Presidential election , although George W. Bush carried Ohio by 2.1%, John Kerry carried Cuyahoga County 66.6%–32.9%, [144] his largest margin in any Ohio county. The city of Cleveland supported Kerry over Bush by the even larger margin of 83.3%–15.8%. [145] 

The city of Cleveland operates on the mayor-council (strong mayor) form of government. [146] The mayor is the chief executive of the city, and the office is held in 2010 by Frank G. Jackson . Previous mayors of Cleveland include progressive Democrat Tom L. Johnson , World War I era War Secretary and founder of Baker Hostetler law firm Newton D. Baker , United States Supreme Court Justice Harold Hitz Burton , Republican Senator George V. Voinovich , two-term Ohio Governor and Senator, former United States Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio's 10th congressional district , Frank J. Lausche , and Carl B. Stokes , the first African American mayor of a major American city. [147] The state of Ohio lost two Congressional seats as a result of the 2010 Census, which affects Cleveland's districts in the northeast part of the state. [148] Crime [ edit ] See also: Cleveland Division of Police 

Between about 1935 to 1938, the Cleveland Torso Murderer killed and dismembered at least a dozen and perhaps twenty people in the area. No arrest was ever made. 

From 2002 to 2014, Ariel Castro held three women as sex slaves in his home in Cleveland. Police became aware of the crime when one of the women escaped. Castro was sentenced to one thousand years in jail, but committed suicide. 

Based on the Morgan Quitno Press 2008 national crime rankings, Cleveland ranked as the 7th most dangerous city in the nation among US cities with a population of 100,000 to 500,000 and the 11th most dangerous overall. [149] Violent crime from 2005 to 2006 was mostly unchanged nationwide, but increased more than 10% in Cleveland. The murder rate dropped 30% in Cleveland, but was still far above the national average. Property crime from 2005 to 2006 was virtually unchanged across the country and in Cleveland, with larceny-theft down by 7% but burglaries up almost 14%. [150] 

In September 2009, the local police arrested Anthony Sowell , who was known in press reports as the Cleveland Strangler. He was convicted of eleven murders as well as other crimes and sentenced to death. 

In October 2010, Cleveland had two neighborhoods appear on ABC News 's list of 'America's 25 Most Dangerous Neighborhoods': both in sections just blocks apart in the city's Central neighborhood on the East Side. Ranked 21st was in the vicinity of Quincy Avenue and E. 40th Streets, while an area near E. 55th and Scovill Avenue ranked 2nd in the nation, just behind a section of the Englewood neighborhood in Chicago, which ranked 1st. [151] [152] 

A study in 1971–72 found that although Cleveland's crime rate was significantly lower than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. [153] In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine . A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity by a combination of removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting. [154] 

The distribution of crime in Cleveland is highly heterogeneous . Relatively few crimes take place in downtown Cleveland's business district, but the perception of crime in the downtown has been pointed to by the Greater Cleveland Growth Association [155] as damaging to the city's economy. [156] More affluent areas of Cleveland and its suburbs have lower rates of violent crime than areas of lower socioeconomic status. Statistically speaking, higher incidences of violent crimes have been noted in some parts of Cleveland with higher populations of African Americans. [157] A study of the relationship between employment access and crime in Cleveland found a strong inverse relationship, with the highest crime rates in areas of the city that had the lowest access to jobs. Furthermore, this relationship was found to be strongest with respect to economic crimes. [158] A study of public housing in Cleveland found that criminals tend to live in areas of higher affluence and move into areas of lower affluence to commit crimes. [159] 

In 2012, Cleveland's crime rate were 84 murders, 3,252 robberies, and 9,740 burglaries. [160] In 2014, the United States Department of Justice published a report that investigated the use of force by the Cleveland Police Department from 2010-2013. The Justice Department found a pattern of excessive force including the use of firearms, tasers, fists, and chemical spray that unnecessarily escalated nonviolent situations, including against the mentally ill and people who were already restrained. As a result of the Justice Department report, the city of Cleveland has agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force. [161] 

On May 26, 2015, the City of Cleveland and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a 105-page agreement addressing concerns about Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) use-of-force policies and practices. Consent decree with Department of Justice [ edit ] 

The agreement follows a two-year Department of Justice investigation, prompted by a request from Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson , [162] to determine whether the CDP engaged in a pattern or practice of the use of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , 42 U.S.C § 14141 (Section 14141"). Under Section 14141, the Department of Justice is granted authority to seek declaratory or equitable relief to remedy a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or federal law. 

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach announced the findings of the DOJ investigation in Cleveland on December 4, 2014. [163] After reviewing nearly 600 use-of-force incidents from 2010 to 2013 and conducting thousands of interviews, the investigators found systemic patterns insufficient accountability mechanisms, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate community engagement. [163] [164] 

At the same time as the announcement of the investigation findings, the City of Cleveland and the Department of Justice issued a Joint Statement of Principles agreeing to begin negotiations with the intention of reaching a court-enforceable settlement agreement. 

The details of the settlement agreement, or consent decree, were released on May 26, 2015. The agreement mandates sweeping changes in training for recruits and seasoned officers, developing programs to identify and support troubled officers, updating technology and data management practices, and an independent monitor to ensure that the goals of the decree are met. The agreement is not an admission or evidence of liability, nor is it an admission by the city, CDP, or its officers and employees that they have engaged in unconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise improper activities or conduct. Pending approval from a federal judge, [165] the consent decree will be implemented and the agreement is binding. Provisions of the consent decree [ edit ] 

The Cleveland Consent Decree is divided into 15 divisions, with 462 enumerated items. [166] At least some of the provisions have been identified as unique to Cleveland: a civilian inspector general who will review the work of the police officers. This position will be appointed by the Mayor but report to the Police Chief. It is intended to provide an additional layer of accountability and scrutiny. [167] an equipment inventory that must result in a study by the police that shows what is needed. [168] 

On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. approved and signed the consent decree. [169] The signing of the agreement starts the clock for numerous deadlines that must be met in an effort to improve the department's handling of use-of-force incidents. [170] Fire department [ edit ] Cleveland Division of Fire (CFD) Agency overview Established April 9, 1863 Employees 760 Staffing Career Fire chief Angelo Calvillo EMS level First Responder BLS Facilities and equipment Battalions 5 Stations 22 Engines 22 Trucks 11 Rescues 2 HAZMAT 1 Fireboats 1(closed) 

Cleveland is served by the firefighters of the Cleveland Division of Fire. [171] The fire department operates out of 22 active fire stations, located throughout the city in five Battalions. Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who reports to an on-duty Assistant Chief. [171] [172] 

The Division of Fire operates a fire apparatus fleet of twenty two engine companies, eight ladder companies, three tower companies, two task force rescue squad companies, hazardous materials ("haz-mat") unit, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units. The current Chief of Department is Patrick Kelly. [173] 

Cleveland EMS is operated by the city as its own department; however, a merger between the fire and EMS departments is in progress. Cleveland EMS units are now based out of most of the city's fire stations as of 2013 [update] . City officials are currently negotiating with Cleveland Fire and EMS to form a new union contract that will merge the two systems entirely. No set projection for a full merger has been established. Neither the Fire nor EMS unions have been able to come to an agreement with city officials on fair terms of merger as of yet. [174] Education [ edit ] Public schools [ edit ] 

The Cleveland Metropolitan School District is the largest K–12 district in the state of Ohio, with 127 schools and an enrollment of 55,567 students during the 2006–2007 academic year. [175] It is the only district in Ohio that is under direct control of the mayor, who appoints a school board . [176] 

Approximately 1 square mile (2.6 km 2 ) of Cleveland, adjacent the Shaker Square neighborhood, is part of the Shaker Heights City School District . The area, which has been a part of the Shaker school district since the 1920s, permits these Cleveland residents to pay the same school taxes as the Shaker residents, as well as vote in the Shaker school board elections. [177] Private schools [ edit ] Benedictine High School Birchwood School Cleveland Central Catholic High School Eleanor Gerson School Montessori High School at University Circle St. Ignatius High School St. Joseph Academy Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School Urban Community School Saint Martin de Porres The Bridge Avenue School [178] Adelbert Hall on the campus of Case Western Reserve University Colleges and universities [ edit ] 

Cleveland is home to a number of colleges and universities. Most prominent among these is Case Western Reserve University , a world-renowned research and teaching institution located in University Circle. A private university with several prominent graduate programs, CWRU was ranked 37th in the nation in 2012 by U.S. News World Report . [179] University Circle also contains Cleveland Institute of Art and the Cleveland Institute of Music . Cleveland State University (CSU), based in Downtown Cleveland , is the city's public four-year university. In addition to CSU, downtown hosts the metropolitan campus of Cuyahoga Community College , the county's two-year higher education institution. Ohio Technical College is also based in Cleveland. [180] The diverse collection of fixed and movable bridges that cross the Cuyahoga River can be seen in the Flats. Media [ edit ] Main article: Media in Cleveland Print [ edit ] 

Cleveland's sole remaining daily newspaper is The Plain Dealer . Defunct major newspapers include the Cleveland Press , an afternoon publication which printed its last edition on June 17, 1982; and the Cleveland News , which ceased publication in 1960. Additional newspaper coverage includes: the Thursdays-only Sun Post-Herald , which serves a few neighborhoods on the city's west side; and the Call and Post , a weekly newspaper that primarily serves the city's African-American community. The city is also served by Cleveland Magazine , a regional culture magazine published monthly; Crain's Cleveland Business , a weekly business newspaper; Cleveland Jewish News , a weekly Jewish newspaper ; and Cleveland Scene , a free alternative weekly paper which absorbed its competitor, the Cleveland Free Times , in 2008. In addition, nationally distributed rock magazine Alternative Press was founded in Cleveland in 1985, and the publication's headquarters remain based in the city. [181] [182] [183] Television [ edit ] 

Combined with nearby Akron and Canton , Cleveland is ranked as the 19th-largest television market by Nielsen Media Research (as of 2013 [update] –14). [184] The market is served by 10 stations affiliated with major American networks, including: WEWS-TV ( ABC ), WJW ( Fox ), WKYC ( NBC ), WOIO ( CBS ), WVIZ ( PBS ), WBNX-TV ( The CW ), WUAB ( MyNetworkTV ), WVPX-TV ( ION ), WQHS-DT ( Univision ), and WDLI-TV ( TBN ). The Mike Douglas Show , a nationally syndicated daytime talk show, began in Cleveland in 1961 on KYW-TV (now WKYC), while The Morning Exchange on WEWS-TV served as the model for Good Morning America . Tim Conway and Ernie Anderson first established themselves in Cleveland while working together at KYW-TV and later WJW-TV (now WJW). Anderson both created and performed as the immensely popular Cleveland horror host Ghoulardi on WJW-TV's Shock Theater , and was later succeeded by the long-running late night duo Big Chuck and Lil' John . [185] [186] [187] [188] Radio [ edit ] 

Cleveland is directly served by 31 AM and FM radio stations , 22 of which are licensed to the city. Commercial FM music stations are frequently the highest rated stations in the market: WAKS ( contemporary hit radio ), WDOK ( adult contemporary ), WENZ ( mainstream urban ), WHLK ( adult hits ), WGAR-FM ( country ), WMJI ( classic hits ), WMMS ( active rock / hot talk ; Indians and Cavaliers FM flagship), WNCX ( classic rock ; Browns co-flagship), WQAL ( hot adult contemporary ), and WZAK ( urban adult contemporary ). WCPN public radio functions as the local NPR affiliate , and sister station WCLV airs a classical music format. College radio stations include WBWC ( Baldwin Wallace University ), WCSB (Cleveland State University), WJCU ( John Carroll University ), and WRUW-FM (Case Western Reserve University). 

News / talk station WTAM serves as the AM flagship for both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians . WKNR and WWGK cover sports via ESPN Radio , while WKRK-FM covers sports via CBS Sports Radio (WKNR and WKRK-FM are also co-flagship stations for the Cleveland Browns ). As WJW (AM), WKNR was once the home of Alan Freed − the Cleveland disc jockey credited with first using and popularizing the term " rock and roll " to describe the music genre. News/talk station WHK was one of the first radio stations to broadcast in the United States and the first in Ohio; its former sister station, rock station WMMS, dominated Cleveland radio in the 1970s and 1980s and was at that time one of the highest rated radio stations in the country. In 1972, WMMS program director Billy Bass coined the phrase "The Rock and Roll Capital of the World" to describe Cleveland. In 1987, Playboy named WMMS DJ Kid Leo (Lawrence Travagliante) "The Best Disc Jockey in the Country". [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] Infrastructure [ edit ] Healthcare [ edit ] 

Cleveland is home to several major hospital systems, two of which are in University Circle. Most notable is the world renowned Cleveland Clinic , which is supplemented by University Hospitals and its Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital . Additionally MetroHealth System , which operates the level one trauma center for northeast Ohio, has various locations throughout greater Cleveland. Cleveland's Global Center for Health Innovation opened with 235,000 square feet (21,800 m 2 ) of display space for healthcare companies across the world. Transportation [ edit ] Airports [ edit ] 

Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is the city's major airport and an international airport that formerly served as a main hub for United Airlines . It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic control tower . Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting FedEx Express , UPS Airlines , United States Postal Service , and major commercial freight carriers. In addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by Burke Lakefront Airport , on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the Shoreway . Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport. [195] Seaport [ edit ] 1992 aerial view of the Cleveland harbor, with the mouth of the Cuyahoga River in the foreground (view towards the east) Cleveland as viewed from Edgewater Park on 4 July 2010 Main article: Port of Cleveland 

The Port of Cleveland , located at the Cuyahoga River's mouth, is a major bulk freight terminal on Lake Erie, receiving much of the raw materials used by the region's manufacturing industries. [196] Railroads [ edit ] 

Amtrak , the national passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited routes, which stop at Cleveland Lakefront Station . Cleveland has also been identified as a hub for the proposed Ohio Hub project, which would bring high-speed rail to Ohio. [197] Cleveland hosts several inter-modal freight railroad terminals. [198] [199] There have been several proposals for commuter rail in Cleveland , including an ongoing (as of January 2011 [200] ) study into a Sandusky –Cleveland line. [201] Transit systems [ edit ] An RTA train arrives at the Shaker Square station 

Cleveland has a bus and rail mass transit system operated by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the RTA Rapid Transit , but local residents refer to it as The Rapid . It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines , and a heavy rail line, the Red Line . In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine , a bus rapid transit line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland . [202] In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America. [203] Cleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square). During construction of the Red Line rapid transit line in the 1950's the citizens of Cleveland voted to build the Downtown Distributor Subway which would have provided a number of Center City stations. The plan was quashed by highway promoting County Engineer Albert S. Porter and the full development and growth of center city Cleveland has since been significantly impeded due to the resulting inaccessibility. Inter-city bus lines [ edit ] 

National intercity bus service is provided at a Greyhound station, located just behind the Playhouse Square theater district. Megabus provides service to Cleveland and has a stop at the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Transit Center on the east side of downtown. [204] Lakefront Trailways provides regional inter-city bus service to popular destinations from their terminal south of Cleveland in Brook Park . [205] Akron Metro , Brunswick Transit Alternative , Laketran , Lorain County Transit , and Medina County Transit provide connecting bus service to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. Geauga County Transit and Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) also offer connecting bus service in their neighboring areas. [206] Roads [ edit ] 

Cleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north-south, and named avenues, which run roughly east-west. The numbered streets are designated "east" or "west", depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects Public Square . [207] The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the west and east sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a "west" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the west side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the Detroit–Superior Bridge and the Lorain–Carnegie Bridge . Freeways [ edit ] 

Three two-digit Interstate highways serve Cleveland directly. Interstate 71 begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with Columbus and Cincinnati . Interstate 77 begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to Akron . Interstate 90 connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east–west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as Dead Man's Curve , then continues northeast, entering Lake County near the eastern split with Ohio State Route 2 . Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, Interstate 480 , which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and Interstate 490 , which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown. [208] 

Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The Cleveland Memorial Shoreway carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries US 6 , US 20 and I-90. The Jennings Freeway ( State Route 176 ) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of Parma and Brooklyn Heights . A third highway, the Berea Freeway ( State Route 237 in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and Brook Park . [209] Walkability [ edit ] 

In 2011, Walk Score ranked Cleveland the seventeenth most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States. [210] As of 2014 [update] , Walk Score increased Cleveland's rank to being the sixteenth most walkable US city, with a Walk Score of 57, a Transit Score of 47, and a Bike Score of 51. Cleveland's most walkable and transient areas can be found in the Downtown , Ohio City , Detroit-Shoreway , University Circle , and Buckeye-Shaker Square neighborhoods. [211] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from Cleveland Sister cities and international relations [ edit ]

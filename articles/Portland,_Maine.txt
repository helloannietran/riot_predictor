Portland is the largest city in the U.S. state of Maine and the county seat of Cumberland County . [5] In 2015, the city proper had a population of 66,881, [6] growing exactly 1 percent since the census of 2010 . The Greater Portland metropolitan area is home to over half a million people, more than one-third of Maine's total population. 

Tourists visit Portland's historic Old Port district along Portland Harbor, at the mouth of the Fore River and part of Casco Bay , and the Arts District , which runs along Congress Street in the center of the city. Portland Head Light is located in nearby Cape Elizabeth and marks the entrance to Portland Harbor. 

The city seal depicts a phoenix rising from ashes, which aligns with the city's motto, Resurgam , Latin for "I will rise again." The motto refers to Portland's recoveries from four devastating fires. [7] Portland, Maine was named for the English Isle of Portland , and the city of Portland, Oregon was in turn named for Portland, Maine. [8] 

Portland Public Schools is the largest school system in Maine, serving more than 7,000 students. [9] With about 230 restaurants, Portland's per capita restaurant density ranks among the top cities in the United States.

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Portland, Maine and Timeline of Portland, Maine Fort Casco, Portland, Maine built by Wolfgang William Romer ; map by Cyprian Southack 

Native Americans originally called the Portland peninsula Machigonne ("Great Neck"). [7] The first European settler was Capt. Christopher Levett , an English naval captain granted 6,000 acres (2,400 ha) in 1623 to found a settlement in Casco Bay . A member of the Council for New England and agent for Ferdinando Gorges , Levett built a stone house where he left a company of ten men, then returned to England and wrote a book about his voyage to drum up support for the settlement. [10] The settlement failed, and the fate of Levett's colonists is unknown. The explorer sailed from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony to meet John Winthrop in 1630, but never returned to Maine. Fort Levett in the harbor is named for him. 

The peninsula was first permanently settled in 1632 as a fishing and trading village named Casco . [7] When the Massachusetts Bay Colony took over Casco Bay in 1658, the town's name changed again to Falmouth . In 1676, the village was destroyed by the Abenaki during King Philip's War . It was rebuilt. During King William's War , a raiding party of French and Native allies attacked and largely destroyed it again in the Battle of Fort Loyal (1690). Gun recovered from USS Maine on Munjoy Hill 

On October 18, 1775, Falmouth was burned in the Revolution by the Royal Navy under command of Captain Henry Mowat . [11] Longfellow Square (c. 1906) 

Following the war, a section of Falmouth called The Neck developed as a commercial port and began to grow rapidly as a shipping center. In 1786, the citizens of Falmouth formed a separate town in Falmouth Neck and named it Portland , after the isle off the coast of Dorset , England. [1] Portland's economy was greatly stressed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (prohibition of trade with the British), which ended in 1809, and the War of 1812 , which ended in 1815. 

In 1820, Maine became a state with Portland as its capital. In 1832, the capital was moved north to Augusta . In 1851, Maine led the nation by passing the first state law prohibiting the sale of alcohol except for "medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes." The law subsequently became known as the Maine law , as 18 states quickly followed. On June 2, 1855, the Portland Rum Riot occurred. 

In 1853, upon completion of the Grand Trunk Railway to Montreal , Portland became the primary ice-free winter seaport for Canadian exports. The Portland Company manufactured more than 600 19th-century steam locomotives . Portland became a 20th-century rail hub as five additional rail lines merged into Portland Terminal Company in 1911. Following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923, Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to Halifax, Nova Scotia , causing marked local economic decline. In the 20th century, icebreakers later enabled ships to reach Montreal in winter, drastically reducing Portland's role as a winter port for Canada. 

On June 26, 1863, a Confederate raiding party led by Captain Charles Read, entered the harbor at Portland and the Battle of Portland Harbor ensued, one of the northernmost battles of the Civil War . The 1866 Great Fire of Portland, Maine of July 4, 1866, ignited during the Independence Day celebration, destroyed most of the commercial buildings in the city, half the churches and hundreds of homes. More than 10,000 people were left homeless. 

By act of the Maine Legislature In 1899, Portland annexed the city of Deering [12] despite a vote by Deering residents rejecting the annexation greatly increasing the size of the city and opening areas for development beyond the peninsula. [13] 

The construction of The Maine Mall , an indoor shopping center established in the suburb of South Portland during the 1970s, economically depressed downtown Portland. The trend reversed when tourists and new businesses started revitalizing the old seaport, locally known as the Old Port. Since the 1990s, the historically industrial Bayside neighborhood saw rapid development. The emerging harborside Ocean Gateway neighborhood at the base of Munjoy Hill [14] [15] [16] The Maine College of Art has been a revitalizing force downtown, attracting students from around the country. The historic Porteous building on Congress Street was restored by the College.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 69.44 square miles (179.85 km 2 ), of which, 21.31 square miles (55.19 km 2 ) is land and 48.13 square miles (124.66 km 2 ) is water. [2] Portland is on a peninsula in Casco Bay on the Gulf of Maine and the Atlantic Ocean. 

Portland borders South Portland , Westbrook and Falmouth . The city is located at 43.66713 N, 70.20717 W. 

Portland has a humid continental climate ( Köppen : Dfb), with rather cold, snowy winters, and warm, occasionally almost hot, summers. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 22.3 °F (−5.4 °C) in January to 69.1 °F (20.6 °C) in July. Daily high temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on only 4.6 days per year on average, while cold-season lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below are reached on 7.7 nights per year on average. [17] The area can be affected by severe nor'easters during winter, with high winds and snowfall totals. Annual precipitation averages 47.2 inches (1,200 mm) and is plentiful year-round, but with a slightly drier summer; snowfall averages 61.9 inches (157 cm). In coastal Maine, winter-season mid-latitude storms can be intense from November to March, while warm-season thunderstorms are markedly less frequent than in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern U.S. Direct strikes by hurricanes or tropical storms are rare, partially due to the normally cooler Atlantic waters off the Maine coast (which weaken tropical systems), but primarily because most tropical systems approaching or reaching 40 degrees North latitude recurve (Coriolis effect), carrying most such storms well south and east of the Portland area. Extremes range from −39 °F (−39 °C) on February 16, 1943 to 103 °F (39 °C) on July 4, 1911 and August 2, 1975. [17]

Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Portland, Maine 

Portland is organized into neighborhoods generally recognized by residents, but they have no legal or political authority. In many cases, city signs identify neighborhoods or intersections (which are often called corners). Most city neighborhoods have a local association, [21] which usually maintains ongoing relations of varying degrees with the city government on issues affecting the neighborhood. 

On March 8, 1899, Portland annexed the neighboring city of Deering. [22] Deering neighborhoods now comprise the northern and eastern sections of the city before the merger. Portland's Deering High School was formerly the public high school for Deering. 

Portland's neighborhoods include the Arts District , Bayside, Bradley's Corner, Cushing's Island, Deering Center, Deering Highlands, Downtown, East Deering , East Bayside, East End, Eastern Cemetery, Great Diamond Island , Highlands, Kennedy Park , Libbytown, [23] Little Diamond Island, Lunt's Corner, Morrill's Corner, Munjoy Hill , Nason's Corner, North Deering , Oakdale, the Old Port, Parkside, Peaks Island , Riverton Park, Rosemont, Stroudwater, the West End, and Woodford's Corner.

Portland has become Maine's economic capital because the city has Maine's largest port, largest population, and is close to Boston (115 miles to the south). Over the years, the local economy has shifted from fishing, manufacturing and agriculture towards a more service-based economy . Most national financial services organizations such as Bank of America , and Key Bank base their Maine operations in Portland. Unum , Magellan Petroleum , Maine Bank Trust , ImmuCell Corp , and Pioneer Telephone have headquarters here, and Portland's neighboring cities of South Portland , Westbrook and Scarborough , provide homes for other corporations. Since 1867, Burnham Morrill Co., maker of B M Baked Beans, has had its main plant in Portland. The plant is considered a local and state landmark. 

The city's port is also undergoing a revival and the first ever container train departed from the new International Marine Terminal with 15 containers of locally produced bottled water recently. 

Americold , a US-based international provider of temperature-controlled storage and distribution, won the port authority's bid to develop a state-of-the-art temperature-controlled storage facility adjacent to the port. The facility will support perishable produce, meats and seafood imports and exports directly through the port and is slated to have construction begin in December 2016. 

Portland has a low unemployment level when compared to national and state averages, 2.9% in October 2015. [30] Portland and surrounding communities also have higher median incomes than most other Maine communities. Fishing vessels (c. 1908) 

The Portland-Montreal Pipe Line , a crude oil pipeline that stretches from South Portland to Montreal , may be a major contributing factor in these rankings. [31] 

Portland is home to increased urban farming , [32] particularly in the East Bayside neighborhood. [33] [34] Culture [ edit ] Flying kites on Kite Day, Bug Light Park Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Old Casco Bank Building Wadsworth-Longfellow House Sites of interest [ edit ]

The spire of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception has been a notable feature of the Portland skyline since its completion in 1854. In 1859, Ammi B. Young designed the Marine Hospital, the first of three local works by Supervising Architects of the U.S. Treasury Department . Although the city lost to redevelopment its 1867 Greek Revival post office, which was designed by Alfred B. Mullett of white Vermont marble and featured a Corinthian portico , Portland retains his equally monumental 1872 granite Second Empire – Renaissance Revival custom house . 

A more recent building of note is Franklin Towers , a 16-story residential tower completed in 1969. At 175 feet (53 meters), [35] it is Portland's (as well as Maine's) tallest building. It is next to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on the city skyline. During the building boom of the 1980s, several new buildings rose on the peninsula, including the 1983 Charles Shipman Payson Building by Henry N. Cobb of Pei, Cobb, Freed Partners at the Portland Museum of Art complex (a component of which is the 1801 McLellan-Sweat Mansion ), and the Back Bay Tower, a 15-story residential building completed in 1990. [36] 

477 Congress Street (known locally as the Time and Temperature Building ) is situated near Monument Square in the Arts District and is a major landmark: the 14-story building features a large electronic sign on its roof that flashes time and temperature data, as well as parking ban information in the winter.

The downtown area of Portland, including the Arts District and the Old Port have a high concentration of eating and drinking establishments, with many more to be found throughout the rest of the peninsula, outlying neighborhoods, and neighboring communities. 

Portland ranks among the top U.S. cities in restaurants and bars per capita. According to the Maine Restaurant Association, Portland is currently home to about 230 restaurants. Many of these institutions cater to niche markets in the culinary world, perhaps most notably the harvest of local sea cucumbers that are primarily exported to Asian markets. [39] 

Portland has developed a national reputation for the quality of its restaurants and eateries. In 2009, Portland was named the "Foodiest Small Town in America" by Bon Appétit magazine, and was featured in the New York Times as a food destination. [40] [41] 

In the spring of 2007, Portland was nominated as one of three finalists for "Delicious Destination of the Year" at the 2007 Food Network Awards . [42] 

Many local chefs have gained national attention over the past few years. [43] [44] [45]

Italian sandwiches are available at many stores, but most famously at Amato's Italian delicatessens, which claims to have originated the sandwich (hence the name). [46] 

The Portland Farmers' Market, which has been in continuous operation since 1768, takes place every Wednesday morning in Monument Square and every Saturday in Deering Oaks Park from early May to the end of November, and every Saturday indoors at 200 Anderson Street in the East Bayside Neighborhood, from early December to the end of April. Fresh fish and seafood can be purchased at a number of markets on the wharves along Commercial Street, and numerous artisan bread makers bake fresh loaves every day. 

Appreciation for sustainable food and farming gained a significant boost throughout the state in the 1970s when back-to-the-landers moved to Maine in droves. With them came the resurgence of farmers' markets (including the expansion of the Portland market), a significant organic farming movement and an increased interest in plant-based cuisine. [47] The echoes of this movement continue in Portland, where restaurants emphasize local and organic food and where the state's greatest concentration of vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly restaurants can be found. 

Portland hosts a number of food and beverage festivals, including: Festival of Nations Greek Festival Harvest on the Harbor Italian Heritage Festival Maine Brewers Festival Maine Vegetarian Vegan Food Festival Taste of the Nation Infrastructure [ edit ] Government [ edit ] City Hall (c. 1910) Closeup of City Hall (2014) 

The city has adopted a council-manager style government that is detailed in the city charter . The citizens of Portland are represented by a nine-member city council which makes policy, passes ordinances, approves appropriations, appoints the city manager and oversees the municipal government. The city council of nine members is elected by the citizens of Portland. The city has five voting districts, with each district electing a city councilor to represent their neighborhood interests for a three-year term. There are also four members of the city council who are elected at-large . [48] 

From 1923 until 2011, city councilors chose one of themselves each year to serve as mayor, a primarily ceremonial position. Two of the most long lasting mayors, with 20 years each, were Connor Knoblock and Conner Walton. On November 2, 2010, Portland voters narrowly approved a measure that allowed them to elect the mayor. On November 8, 2011, former State Senator and candidate for U.S. Congress Michael F. Brennan was elected as mayor. On December 5, 2011, he was sworn in as the first citizen-elected mayor in 88 years (see Portland, Maine mayoral election, 2011 ). The office of mayor is a four-year paid position. [49] The current mayor is Ethan Strimling , who defeated Brennan in the 2015 election . 

A city manager is appointed by the city council. The city manager oversees the daily operations of the city government, appoints the heads of city departments, and prepares annual budgets. The city manager directs all city agencies and departments, and is responsible for the executing laws and policies passed by the city council. [48] The current city manager is Jon Jennings . 

Aside from the main city council there is also an elected school board for the Portland Public School system . The school board is made up in the same manner of the city council with five district members, four at-large members and one chairman. [50] There are also three students from the local high schools elected to serve on the board. There are many other boards and committees such as the Planning Committee, Board of Appeals, and Harbor Commission, etc. These committees and boards have limited power in their respective areas of expertise. Members of boards and committees are appointed by city council members. 

On November 5, 2013, Portland voters overwhelmingly approved an ordinance to legalize the possession and private use of cannabis for adults, making the city the first municipality in the Eastern United States to do so. [51]

The Port of Portland is the second-largest cruise and passenger destination in the state (next to Bar Harbor ), and is served by the Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal . Ferry service is available year-round to many destinations in Casco Bay . From 2006 to 2009, Bay Ferries operated a high speed ferry called The Cat featuring a five-hour trip to Yarmouth , Nova Scotia for summer passengers and cars. Before that, the Scotia Prince Cruises trip took eleven hours. A proposal to replace the defunct Nova Scotia ferry services was rejected in 2013 by Nova Scotia's government. From May 15, 2014 until October 2015, the cruise ship ferry Nova Star made daily trips from Portland to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. [59] Due to poor passenger numbers and financial problems, Nova Scotia selected Bay Ferries, the prior operator of The Cat , to operate the service starting in 2016. Nova Scotia cited Bay Ferries' experience and industry relationships in making its decision. Nova Star officials pledged a smooth transition to the new operator. [60] The Nova Star was later ordered seized by federal marshals for nonpayment of bills. [61] The USNS Puerto Rico , the boat to be used on the Portland-Yarmouth ferry run 

Bay Ferries announced on March 24, 2016 that they had chartered the former Hawaii Superferry boat USNS Puerto Rico from the US Navy to use for the Portland-Yarmouth service, for a two-year period. Bay Ferries signed a 10-year deal with Nova Scotia to run the ferry route, which will take about five and a half hours to run in a crossing. They stated that the boat would be renamed The Cat [62] and that service would begin around June 15, after the boat was refitted in a South Carolina shipyard. There is still a dispute as to whether the ferry will be permitted to carry trucks, which is desired by Nova Scotia businesses, but opposed by the City of Portland. [63] 

The Casco Bay Lines operates several passenger ferries with dozens of trips every day year-round to the major populated islands of Casco Bay. The service to Peaks Island also provides an auto ferry for most of its schedule. Local buses and taxis [ edit ]

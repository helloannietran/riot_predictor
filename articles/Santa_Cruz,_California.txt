Santa Cruz ( / ˈ s æ n t ə ˈ k r uː z / , Spanish : Holy Cross ) is the county seat and largest city of Santa Cruz County , California . As of 2013 the U.S. Census Bureau estimated Santa Cruz's population at 62,864. 

Situated on the northern edge of Monterey Bay , about 32 mi (51 km) south of San Jose and 75 mi (120 km) south of San Francisco , the city is part of the 12-county San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Combined Statistical Area . 

Santa Cruz is known for its moderate climate, the natural beauty of its coastline, redwood forests, alternative community lifestyles, and socially liberal leanings. It is also home to the University of California, Santa Cruz , a premier research institution and educational hub, as well as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk , an oceanfront amusement park operating continuously since 1907. 

The present-day site of Santa Cruz was the location of Spanish settlement beginning in 1791, including Mission Santa Cruz and the pueblo of Branciforte . Following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48, California became the 31st state in 1850. The City of Santa Cruz was incorporated in 1866 and chartered in April 1876. [1] Important early industries included lumber, gunpowder , lime and agriculture. Late in the 19th century, Santa Cruz established itself as a beach resort community .

History [ edit ] The Awaswa and pre-contact period [ edit ] 

Prior to the arrival of Spanish soldiers, missionaries and colonists in the late 18th century, Santa Cruz County was home to the Awaswas Native Americans. The misnomer Ohlone, while often used to describe the native people of the Santa Cruz area, is a generalized name for the many diverse groups that lived in the region stretching from San Francisco to the Monterey Bay. The diverse and numerous tribes of this region were also earlier referred to by the Spanish as Coastanoan. The term "Ohlone" has been used in place of "Costanoan" since the 1970s by some descendant groups and by most ethnographers, historians, and writers of popular literature. Awaswa was one of the eight Coastanoan languages and made up a tribe of Native Americas living in Western Santa Cruz County, stretching slightly north of Davenport to Rio Del Mar. The Awaswas tribe was made up of no more than one thousand people and their language is now extinct. The only remnants of their spoken language are three local place names: Aptos , Soquel and Zayante . The majority of Ohlone or Coastanoan tribes had no written language, and lived in small villages scattered around the Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay regions. Within fifty years of the Spaniards' arrival, the Ohlone or Coastanoan culture and way of life had virtually disappeared in the Bay area. Today, two of the Coastanoan tribes, the Awaswa people 'missionized' in Santa Cruz and the Mutsun people 'missionized' at San Juan Batista, have joined together as the Amah Mutsan Tribal Band in an effort to protect and maintain the authentic and distinct cultural history and practices. [13] [14] Mission and Pueblo period [ edit ] 

The first European land exploration of Alta California , the Spanish Portolà expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà , passed through the area on its way north, still searching for the "port of Monterey" described by Sebastian Vizcaino in 1602. The party forded the river (probably near where the Soquel Avenue bridge now stands) and camped nearby on October 17, 1769 . Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi , traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, "This river was named San Lorenzo." (for Saint Lawrence ). 

Next morning, the expedition set out again, and Crespi noted that, "Five hundred steps after we started we crossed a good arroyo of running water which descends from some high hills where it rises. It was named Santa Cruz." [15] (which translates as "Holy Cross Creek"). [16] 

In 1791, Father Fermín Lasuén continued the use of Crespi's name when he declared the establishment of La Misión de la Exaltación de la Santa Cruz (also known as Mission Santa Cruz ) for the conversion of the Awaswas of Chatu-Mu and surrounding Ohlone villages . [17] Santa Cruz was the twelfth mission to be founded in California . The creek, however, later lost the name, and is known today as Laurel Creek because it parallels Laurel Street. It is the main feeder of Neary Lagoon. [18] 

In 1797, Governor Diego de Borica , by order of the Viceroy of New Spain , Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca y Branciforte, marqués de Branciforte , established the Villa de Branciforte , a town named in honor of the Viceroy. [19] One of only three civilian towns established in California during the Spanish colonial period (the other two became Los Angeles and San Jose), the Villa was located across the San Lorenzo River , less than a mile from the Mission. Its original main street is now North Branciforte Avenue. Villa de Branciforte later lost its civic status, and in 1905 the area was annexed into the City of Santa Cruz. 

In the 1820s, newly independent Mexico assumed control of the area. [20] Following the secularization of the Mission in 1834 , the community that had grown up around the Mission was renamed Pueblo de Figueroa . The name didn't catch on, however, and later reverted to Santa Cruz. After 1834, immigrants from the United States began to arrive in steadily increasing numbers. In 1848, following the Mexican–American War , Mexico ceded the territory of Alta California to the U.S. in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . California was the first portion of the territory to become a state, in 1850. Santa Cruz became a city in 1866. 

The Santa Cruz mission was one of the first missions to be secularized . After secularization the Indian population began to disappear and the buildings slowly began to fall apart and collapse. The church tower fell in 1840 and the church itself was destroyed in a 1857 earthquake. In 1858 a “modern” church was built on the original church site. The church that stands there today was built in 1889 in a gothic style. Santa Cruz was one of the first missions to be abandoned and private residencies were built on the property. [21] The Native People [ edit ] 

The Native Americans of Santa Cruz are known to be the Costanonan people. The Coastanoan occupied the area from Monterey to San Francisco. Coastanoan is derived from the Spanish word which means “coastal people”. The term Ohlone is another general term that is used to designate speakers of the Coastanoan language. The Costanonan people spoke eight known languages and each language defines a different tribelet. After the mission era, the number of native people in the Bay Area, including Santa Cruz, began to decrease. As the missions closed, most of the Natives living on the missions became laborers on area ranches. Shortly after the missions closing there were a few communities of native people that were composed of Indians from different tribes that had lived on the missions, however as younger generations moved away, these communities diminished. No official government recognition has ever been given to the Costanonans. [22] 

Coastanoan is an anglicized word for Costanos or coast people. The ancestors of the Costanoan people are thought to have originally migrated to the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Area from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River system sometime around A.D. 500. With the arrival of the Spanish, the Coastanoan people experienced a cultural disruption. During their time with the missions the Coastanoan people experienced cultural shock, mistreatment and disease brought to them from the missionaries. In 1843, 14 years after Mexico won its independence from Spain, the California missions were ordered to turn all their lands over to the new government. this missions and all their lands. After 60 years of missions, the Indian people who inhabited those lands were kicked off. After being turned out by the missions the remaining Costanoan/Ohlone people struggle to survive and many became servants or agricultural laborers or vaqueros. Some small communities were formed after this which promoted old ways but in different locations from their homelands. [23] Civil War [ edit ] California Powder Works 

California Powder Works began manufacturing blasting powder for California mining when normal supplies were interrupted by the American Civil War . A powder mill built on the San Lorenzo River upstream of Santa Cruz used charcoal and powder kegs manufactured from local forests. The mill later manufactured smokeless powder used in United States Army Krag-Jørgensen rifles and guns of the United States Navy Pacific and Asiatic fleets. The mill was heavily damaged by a series of explosions on the evening of April 26, 1898. The explosions caused flaming debris to fall on Mission Hill and caused fires threatening the city. The powder works employed 150 to 275 men until operations ceased in 1914. [24] Recent history [ edit ] 

Santa Cruz was hard hit by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . It was also hit by ocean surges caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami , wherein the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor sustained an estimated $10 million of damage, with another $4 million of damage to docked boats there. [25] Social activism [ edit ] Street musicians 

Founded in 1976, The Resource Center for Nonviolence is one of the oldest and most centrally located non-profit organizations committed to political and social activism in Santa Cruz County. [26] The center is "dedicated to promoting the principles of nonviolent social change and enhancing the quality of life and human dignity". [27] In 1998, the Santa Cruz community declared itself a Nuclear-free zone , [28] and in 2003, the Santa Cruz City Council became the first City Council in the U.S. to denounce the Iraq War. [29] The City Council of Santa Cruz also issued a proclamation opposing the USA PATRIOT Act . [30] 

As a center of liberal and progressive activism, [31] Santa Cruz became one of the first cities to approve marijuana for medicinal uses. In 1992, residents overwhelmingly approved Measure A, [32] which allowed for the medicinal uses of marijuana. Santa Cruz was home to the second above-ground medical marijuana club in the world when the Santa Cruz Cannabis Buyers Club opened its doors in April 1995. Santa Cruz also became one of the first cities in California to test the state's medical marijuana laws in court after the arrest of Valerie Corral and Mike Corral , founders of the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana , by the DEA . [33] The case was ruled in favor of the growers. In 2005, the Santa Cruz City Council established a city government office to assist residents with obtaining medical marijuana. [34] On November 7, 2006, the voters of Santa Cruz passed Measure K by a vote of 64–36 percent. Measure K made adult non-medical cannabis offenses the lowest priority for law enforcement; this does not apply to cultivation, distribution, sale in public, sale to minors, or driving under the influence. [35] [36] The measure requests the Santa Cruz city clerk send letters annually to state and federal representatives advocating reform of cannabis laws. [37] 

Notable feminist activists Nikki Craft and Ann Simonton resided in Santa Cruz, where they formed the "Praying Mantis Brigade". This collection of activists organized the "Myth California Pageant" in the 1980s protesting "the objectification of women and the glorification of the beauty myth." [38] [39] Myth California was staged concurrently with the Miss California pageant held in Santa Cruz since the 1920s. The protests ran for nine years and eventually contributed to the Miss California pageant leaving Santa Cruz. [40] Simonton founded and coordinates the non-profit group "Media Watch" which monitors and critiques media images of women and ethnic minorities. [41] [42] [43] Beginning in 1983 Santa Cruz has hosted an annual Take Back the Night candlelight vigil, rally, march, and protest focusing on the issue of violence against women. [44] 

Riots occurred on May 1, 2010, sparked when leftist extremists threw jugs of paint at police cars and painted anarchist symbols and anti-capitalist phrases onto buildings. Property damages are estimated to top roughly $100,000. Prior to the riot, a May Day rally was being held for worker and immigrant rights. [45] According to police, the rally was infiltrated by a local anarchists group, who used the rally as a cover for attacking corporate premises. The riots started when the protesters started vandalizing nearby buildings; by 10:30 pm, approximately, a dozen buildings were already vandalized. [45] It then intensified when a group of about ten people began breaking storefront windows at approximately 11:05 pm. [46] Several police officers were stationed downtown, but retreated after protesters threw stones at their vehicles. After calling in backup resources from around the county, law enforcement reached the riots at 11:23 pm, over 45 minutes after it began, due to a large number of phony 911 calls, which diverted the police force all around the county. [46] 

Occupy Santa Cruz formed as an autonomous organization in solidarity with the worldwide Occupy movement , a broad-based protest against perceived economic and social inequality. Occupy Santa Cruz was most active in the fall of 2011, and included over a thousand active members at its peak. [ citation needed ] The organization gained most of its publicity when members occupied an empty bank building owned by Wells Fargo . [47] and occupied the building for 72 hours. [48] 11 criminal charges were filed, at least seven of which have since been dropped. [48] Geography [ edit ]

By the 1860s, Pacific Avenue had become the main street of downtown Santa Cruz, and remains so today. Local architect Kermit Darrow and landscape architect Roy Rydell were engaged in 1969 to convert several blocks of Pacific Avenue into a semi-pedestrian street named the Pacific Garden Mall. [72] The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 destroyed nearly all of the 19th-century buildings in the downtown area. After the earthquake, the Pacific Garden Mall theme was eliminated, and an updated downtown design plan by ROMA Design Group was implemented. [73] As of 2016, only one empty lot remains on Pacific Avenue from the destruction of the 1989 earthquake. 

Downtown Santa Cruz houses a variety of storefronts and businesses.

Pogonip Open Space is located adjacent to the University of California, Santa Cruz . It includes second-growth oak and redwood forest, meadows and several streams, and is crossed by several hiking trails. Pogonip was the name of the former country club there, which once had a golf course and polo field. The name Pogonip is similar to a Shoshoni language word for a type of " ice fog " that occurs in cold-winter climates of the western U.S., forming beard-like ice crystal accumulations on almost any surface, but especially on the branches of trees and bushes. The climate of Santa Cruz is, however, too warm for that type of ice formation, and none of the native Californian peoples are Shoshonean.

Like underwater parks, marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems. Most of the rest of the coastline of Santa Cruz lies adjacent to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary . Sports and recreation [ edit ] Roof of the Looff Carousel building at the Boardwalk

[75] The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum at Steamer Lane is staffed by docents from the Santa Cruz Surfing Club who have surfed Santa Cruz waves since the 1930s. Santa Cruz hosts several surf contests drawing international participants each year, including the O'Neill Cold Water Classic, the International Longboard Association contest, and many others.

After Huntington Beach , California, trademarked the "Surf City USA" name, Santa Cruz politicians tried to stop the mark from being registered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because of a 10-year-old controversy over Santa Cruz's nickname "Surf City." [97] Huntington Beach has obtained a total of seven registrations for the "Surf City USA" trademark. [98] None of these registrations of the trademark are on the principal register , but on the secondary register , which means that Huntington Beach has no exclusive right to assert ownership over the "Surf City USA" trademark. Two Santa Cruz surf shops, Shoreline Surf Shop and Noland's on the Wharf, sued the city of Huntington Beach in order to protect the public use of the term "Surf City." [99] The parties reached a confidential settlement in January 2008, in which neither side admitted liability and all claims and counterclaims were dismissed. The Santa Cruz surf shops continue to print T-shirts, and the Visitor's Bureau retains the right to use the trademark. [100] In 2009 Steve Marble, of Los Angeles Times' L.A. Now news blog, wrote an article The real Surf City? It's Santa Cruz, says magazine saying: "But Surfer magazine proclaims Santa Cruz to be 'The Real Surf City, USA,' after it considered the surf, food and vibe of the nations' best known surf towns." Steve Marble quotes Surfer : "Huntington Beach may have won the right to the name ‘Surf City, USA’ in the California courts, but any surfer who’s ever paddled out at Steamer Lane knows the judge got it wrong.” [2] Pop culture references [ edit ] California Sea Lions at Santa Cruz coast In the 1963 Beach Boys song " Surfin' U.S.A.

Tamil Nadu ( / ˈ t æ m ɪ l ˈ n ɑː d uː / TAM -il- NAH -doo ; pronunciation ( help · info ) ; literally The Land of Tamils ( தமிழர் ) or Tamil Country ) is one of the 29 states of India . Its capital and largest city is Chennai (formerly known as Madras). Tamil Nadu [6] lies in the southernmost part of the Indian Peninsula and is bordered by the union territory of Puducherry and the South Indian states of Kerala , Karnataka , and Andhra Pradesh . It is bounded by the Eastern Ghats on the north, by the Nilgiri , the Anamalai Hills , and Kerala on the west, by the Bay of Bengal in the east, by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait on the southeast, and by the Indian Ocean on the south. The state shares a maritime border with the nation of Sri Lanka . 

Tamil Nadu is the eleventh-largest state in India by area and the sixth-most populous. The state was ranked sixth among states in India according to the Human Development Index in 2011, with the second-largest state economy. [3] [7] Tamil Nadu is the second largest state economy in India with ₹ 4,789 billion (US$71 billion) in gross domestic product. [8] The state has the highest number (10.56 per cent) of business enterprises and stands second in total employment (9.97 per cent) in India, [9] compared with the population share of about 6 per cent. Tamil Nadu was ranked as one of the top seven developed states in India based on a "Multidimensional Development Index" in a 2013 report published by a panel headed by current RBI governor Raghuram Rajan . [10] Its official language is Tamil , which is one of the longest-surviving classical languages in the world. [11] 

Tamil Nadu is home to many natural resources. In addition, its people have developed and continue classical arts, classical music, and classical literature. Historic buildings and religious sites include Hindu temples of Tamil architecture , hill stations , beach resorts, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, and eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Tamil Nadu Prehistory [ edit ] 

Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations in the Indian peninsula. [14] In Adichanallur , 24 km (15 mi) from Tirunelveli , archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) unearthed 169 clay urns containing human skulls, skeletons, bones, husks, grains of rice, charred rice and celts of the Neolithic period, 3,800 years ago. [15] The ASI archaeologists have proposed that the script used at that site is "very rudimentary" Tamil Brahmi . [16] Adichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site for further excavation and studies. [17] About 60 per cent of the total epigraphical inscriptions found by the ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu, and most of these are in the Tamil language . [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Indus valley script between 2000 and 1500 BC [ edit ] 

A Neolithic stone celt (a hand-held axe) with the Indus script on it was discovered at Sembian-Kandiyur near Mayiladuthurai in Tamil Nadu. According to epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan , this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. Mahadevan claimed that the find was evidence of the use of the Harappan language , and therefore that the "Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a Tamil language ". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BC and 2000 BC. [27] Sangam period (300 BC – AD 300) [ edit ] Main articles: Sangam period , Tamilakam , and Sangam landscape Sage Agastya father of Tamil literature, Sangam period 

The early history of the people and rulers of Tamil Nadu is a topic in Tamil literary sources known as Sangam literature . Numismatic, archaeological and literary sources corroborate that the Sangam period lasted for about six centuries, from 300 BC to AD 300. 

Three dynasties, namely the Chera , Chola and Pandya , ruled the area of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala . The Chera ruled the whole of present-day Kerala and parts of western Tamil Nadu comprising Coimbatore , Dharmapuri , Karur , Salem and Erode districts from the capital of Vanchi Muthur (thought to be modern day Karur ). The Chola dynasty ruled the northern and central parts of Tamil Nadu from their capital, Uraiyur ; and the Pandya dynasty ruled southern Tamil Nadu, from capitals at Korkai and Madurai . 

All three dynasties had extensive trade relationships with Rome, Greece, Egypt, Ceylon , Phoenicia , Arabia , Mesopotamia and Persia . Trade flourished in commodities such as spices, ivory, pearls, beads and gems. Chera traded extensively from Muziris on the west coast, Chola from Arikamedu and Puhar and Pandya through Korkai port. A Greco-Roman trade and travel document, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. AD 60 – 100) gives a description of the Tamil country and its ports. 

Besides these three dynasties, the Sangam era Tamilakam (Tamil homeland) was also divided into various provinces named 'nadu', meaning 'country'. Sangam literature refers these provinces as "koduntamil mandalam" which were not exactly political or socio-cultural units but linguistic agglomerations like Kongu Nadu , Puzhinadu , Thondai Nadu , Nanjilnadu , Ay Nadu and Venadu . 

Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the three Tamil kingdoms were overwhelmed by the Kalabhras . The period of their rule is sometimes referred to as the "Dark Age" in Tamil history and little is known about it. The Kalabhras were expelled by the Pallavas , Mutharaiyar , Badami Chalukyas and Pandyas in the 6th century.

Tamiḻakam during Sangam Period. Bhakti Movement [ edit ] Main article: Bhakti Movement Sambandar , one of the sixty-three Nayanars , ( Bhakti Movement) 

The Bhakti movement originated in Tamil speaking region of south India and spread northwards through India. The Bhakti Movement was a rapid growth of bhakti beginning in this region with the Saiva Nayanars (4th–10th centuries) [28] and the Vaisnava Alvars who spread bhakti poetry and devotion. [28] [29] The Alwars and Nayanmars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. Medieval period (600–1300) [ edit ] Kallanai or Grand Anicut, an ancient dam built on the Kaveri River in Tiruchirappalli by Karikala Chola around the 2nd century AD [30] [31] [32] [33] Shore Temple built by the Pallavas at Mamallapuram during the 8th century, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site 

During the 4th to 8th centuries, Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallava dynasty under Mahendravarman I and his son Mamalla Narasimhavarman I . [34] The Pallavas ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Tamil architecture reached its peak during Pallava rule. Narasimhavarman II built the Shore Temple which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The Meenakshi Amman Temple 

Much later, the Pallavas were replaced by the Chola dynasty as the dominant kingdom in the 9th century and they in turn were replaced by the Pandyan Dynasty in the 13th century. The Pandyan capital Madurai was in the deep south away from the coast. They had extensive trade links with the south east Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors, as well as contacts, even formal diplomatic contacts, reaching as far as the Roman Empire . During the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. Temples such as the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai and Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli are the best examples of Pandyan temple architecture. [35] The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south coast of India, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world. Chola Empire [ edit ] Main article: Chola dynasty The Chola Empire at its greatest extent, during the reign of Rajendra Chola I in 1030 

During the 9th century, the Chola dynasty was once again revived by Vijayalaya Chola , who established Thanjavur as Chola's new capital by conquering central Tamil Nadu from Mutharaiyar and the Pandya king Varagunavarman II . Aditya I and his son Parantaka I expanded the kingdom to the northern parts of Tamil Nadu by defeating the last Pallava king, Aparajitavarman . Parantaka Chola II expanded the Chola empire into what is now interior Andhra Pradesh and coastal Karnataka, while under the great Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola , the Cholas rose to a notable power in south east Asia. Now the Chola Empire stretched as far as Bengal and Sri Lanka. At its peak, the empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km 2 (1,400,000 sq mi). Rajaraja Chola conquered all of peninsular south India and parts of Sri Lanka. Rajendra Chola 's navy went even further, occupying coasts from Burma (now ) to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , Lakshadweep, Sumatra , Java , Malaya , Philippines [36] in South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated Mahipala , the king of Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital and named it Gangaikonda Cholapuram . 

The Cholas were prolific temple builders right from the times of the first medieval king Vijayalaya Chola . These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the Pallavas , acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated Nataraja temple at Chidambaram and the Sri Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangam held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities. Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola built temples such as the Brihadeshvara Temple of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram , the Airavatesvara Temple of Darasuram and the Sarabeswara (Shiva) Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at Thirubhuvanam , the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam. The first three of the above four temples are titled Great Living Chola Temples among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites . Architecture from Chola period From left to right: Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram; Natarajan , Shiva as celestial dancer; and Parvathi, the consort of Shiva 

The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes all over the world. Among the existing specimens in museums around the world and in the temples of southern India the fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi , and the Siva saints are the examples of Chola fgbronze. Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptors worked with great freedom in the 11th and the 12th centuries to achieve a classic grace and grandeur. The best example of this can be seen in the form of Nataraja the Divine Dancer . This is awesome period for Chola Empire. Vijayanagar and Nayak period (1336–1646) [ edit ] Main article: Vijayanagara Empire Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal at Madurai 

The Muslim invasions of southern India triggered the establishment of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire with Vijayanagara in modern Karnataka as its capital. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates . Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called Nayaks , succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom. [35] The Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent of Nayaks in the 17th century. They reconstructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu such as the Meenakshi Temple . Power struggles of the 18th century (1692–1801) [ edit ] 

By the early 18th century, the political scene in Tamil Nadu saw a major change-over and was under the control of many minor rulers aspiring to be independent. The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the sultanate of Golconda a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the nawab of the Carnatic , who had his seat in Arcot from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the Thanjavur Nayaks led to a short lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom . The fall of the Madurai Nayaks brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as Palaiyakkarar (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic. Fort Dansborg at Tharangambadi built by the Danish 

Europeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions. Around 1609, the Dutch established a settlement in Pulicat , [37] while the Danes had their establishment in Tharangambadi also known as Tranquebar. [38] In 1639, the British, under the East India Company, established a settlement further south of Pulicat, in present-day Chennai . British constructed Fort St. George [39] and established a trading post at Madras. [40] By 1693, the French established in trading posts at Pondichéry . The British and French were competing to expand the trade in the northern parts of Tamil Nadu which also witnessed many battles like Battle of Wandiwash as part of the Seven Years' War . [41] British reduced the French dominions in India to Puducherry. Nawabs of the Carnatic bestowed tax revenue collection rights on the East India Company for defeating the Kingdom of Mysore . Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah surrendered much of his territory to the East India Company which firmly established the British in the northern parts. In 1762, a tripartite treaty was signed between Thanjavur Maratha, Carnatic and the British by which Thanjavur became a vassal of the Nawab of the Carnatic which eventually ceded to British. 

In the south, Nawabs granted taxation rights to the British which led to conflicts between British and the Palaiyakkarar, which resulted in series of wars called Polygar war to establish independent states by the aspiring Palaiyakkarar. Puli Thevar was one of the earliest opponents of the British rule in South India. [42] Thevar's prominent exploits were his confrontations with Marudhanayagam , who later rebelled against the British in the late 1750s and early 1760s. Rani Velu Nachiyar , was the first woman freedom fighter of India and Queen of Sivagangai. [43] She was drawn to war after her husband Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar (1750–1772), King of Sivaganga was murdered at Kalayar Kovil temple by British. Before her death, Queen Velu Nachi granted powers to the Maruthu brothers to rule Sivaganga. [44] Kattabomman (1760–1799), Palaiyakkara chief of Panchalakurichi who fought the British in the First Polygar War . [45] He was captured by the British at the end of the war and hanged near Kayattar in 1799. Veeran Sundaralingam (1700–1800) was the General of Kattabomman Nayakan's palayam, who died in the process of blowing up a British ammunition dump in 1799 which killed more than 150 British soldiers to save Kattapomman Palace. Oomaithurai , younger brother of Kattabomman, took asylum under the Maruthu brothers , Periya Marudhu and Chinna Marudhu and raised an army [46] . They formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja which fought the British in Second Polygar Wars. Dheeran Chinnamalai (1756–1805), Polygar chieftain of Kongu and feudatory of Tipu Sultan who fought the British in the Second Polygar War. After winning the Polygar wars in 1801, the East India Company consolidated most of southern India into the Madras Presidency . Srivilliputhur Andal Temple Gopuram has been adopted as the official Seal of Tamil Nadu During British rule (1801–1947) [ edit ] Main article: Madras Presidency 

At the beginning of the 19th century, the British firmly established governance over the entire Tamil Nadu. The Vellore mutiny on 10 July 1806 was the first instance of a large-scale and violent mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, predating the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by half a century. [47] The revolt, which took place in Vellore , was brief, lasting only one full day, but brutal as mutineers broke into the Vellore fort and killed or wounded 200 British troops, before they were subdued by reinforcements from nearby Arcot. [48] [49] The British crown took over the control governance from the Company and the remainder of the 19th century did not witness any native resistance until the beginning of 20th century Indian Independence movements. During the period of governor George Harris Harris (1854–1859), measures were taken to improve education and increase representation of Indians in the administration. Legislative powers given to the Governor's council under the Indian Councils Act 1861 and 1909 Minto-Morley Reforms eventually led to the establishment of the Madras Legislative Council . Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in two severe famine in the Madras Presidency, the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Indian famine of 1896–97 . The famine led to migration of people as bonded labours for British to various countries which eventually formed the present Tamil diaspora . India (1947–present) [ edit ] 

When India became independent in 1947, Madras presidency became Madras state , comprising present-day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh up to Ganjam district in Orissa, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil country". [50] Geography [ edit ] Topographic map of Tamil Nadu Western Ghats traverse along the western border of Tamil Nadu View of Podhigai hills from Poovankurichi , Tirunelveli 

Tamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km 2 (50,216 sq mi), and is the eleventh largest state in India. The bordering states are Kerala to the west, Karnataka to the north west and Andhra Pradesh to the north. To the east is the Bay of Bengal and the state encircles the union territory of Puducherry . The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is Kanyakumari which is the meeting point of the Arabian Sea , the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean. 

The western, southern and the north western parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats meet at the Nilgiri hills . The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions. 

Tamil Nadu has a coastline of about 1,076 km (669 mi) which is the country's second longest coastline. Tamil Nadu's coastline bore the brunt of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami when it hit India, which caused 7,793 direct deaths in the state. Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II III. Historically, parts of this region have experienced seismic activity in the M5.0 range. [51] Climate [ edit ] Paddy fields near Gobichettipalayam after monsoon 

Tamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains, and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has two distinct periods of rainfall: south west monsoon from June to September, with strong southwest winds; North east monsoon from October to December, with dominant north east winds; 

The annual rainfall of the state is about 945 mm (37.2 in) of which 48 per cent is through the north east monsoon, and 32 per cent through the south west monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe drought. [52] Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: north east, north west, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri Delta (the most fertile agricultural zone). Flora and fauna [ edit ] Main articles: Wildlife of Tamil Nadu and List of birds of Tamil Nadu 

There are about 2000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu. Protected areas provide safe habitat for large mammals including elephants , tigers , leopards , wild dogs , sloth bears , gaurs , lion-tailed macaques , Nilgiri langurs , Nilgiri tahrs , grizzled giant squirrels and sambar deer , resident and migratory birds such as cormorants , darters , herons , egrets , open-billed storks , spoonbills and white ibises , little grebes , Indian moorhen , black-winged stilts , a few migratory ducks and occasionally grey pelicans , marine species such as the dugongs , turtles, dolphins, Balanoglossus and a wide variety of fish and insects. The endangered lion-tailed macaque 

Indian Angiosperm diversity comprises 17,672 species with Tamil Nadu leading all states in the country, with 5640 species accounting for 1/3 of the total flora of India. This includes 1559 species of medicinal plants , 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants and 230 red-listed species. The Gymnosperm diversity of the country is 64 species of which Tamil Nadu has four indigenous species and about 60 introduced species. The Pteridophytes diversity of India includes 1022 species of which Tamil Nadu has about 184 species. Vast numbers of bryophytes , lichen , fungi, algae and bacteria are among the wild plant diversity of Tamil Nadu. 

Common plant species include the state tree: palmyra palm , eucalyptus , rubber, cinchona , clumping bamboos ( Bambusa arundinacea ), common teak , Anogeissus latifolia , Indian laurel , grewia , and blooming trees like Indian labumusum , ardisia , and solanaceae . Rare and unique plant life includes Combretum ovalifolium , ebony ( Diospyros nilagrica ), Habenaria rariflora (orchid), Alsophila , Impatiens elegans , Ranunculus reniformis , and royal fern .

Prior to Indian independence Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the Madras Presidency . The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the Indian National Congress (INC). Regional parties have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, Justice Party , by it opponents. Later, South Indian Liberal Federation was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India. 

The Justice Party which was under E.V.Ramaswamy was renamed Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called Dravida Nadu . However, due to the differences between its two leaders EVR and C.N. Annadurai , the party was split. Annadurai left the party to form the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. Post-Independence [ edit ] Political

Re-organisation of Indian states according to linguistic and ethnic basis has moderated Tamil nationalism, especially the demand for separation from the Indian Union. The Anti-Hindi agitations in the mid-1960s made the DMK more popular and a more powerful political force in the state. The DMK routed the INC in the 1967 elections and took control of the state government, ending INC's stronghold in Tamil Nadu. C.N. Annadurai became the DMK's first Chief Minister . M Karunanidhi took over as Chief Minister and party leader after Annadurai's death in 1969. Karunanidhi's leadership was soon challenged by MG Ramachandran , popularly known as MGR. In 1972, he split from DMK and formed the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) and later renamed the party as All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. He was the Chief Minister of the state from 1977 until his death in 1987. After the death of MGR, AIADMK was defeated in 1989 assembly polls because of the split of the party into two factions headed by Janaki (wife of MGR) and Jayalalithaa. Later on J. Jayalalithaa took control of the party. She was elected as the General Secretary of the unified AIADMK. There have been several splits in both the DMK and the AIADMK, but since 1967 one of those two parties has held power in the state.

Tamil Nadu is one of the most literate states in India. [84] Tamil Nadu has performed reasonably well in terms of literacy growth during the decade 2001–2011. A survey conducted by the Industry body Assocham ranks Tamil Nadu top among Indian states with about 100 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in primary and upper primary education. One of the basic limitations for improvement in education in the state is the rate of absence of teachers in public schools, which at 21.4 per cent is significant.

Tamil Nadu has a long tradition of venerable culture. [90] Tamil Nadu is known for its rich tradition of literature, art, music and dance which continue to flourish today. Tamil Nadu is a land most known for its monumental ancient Hindu temples and classical form of dance Bharata Natyam . [91] Unique cultural features like Bharatanatyam [92] (dance), Tanjore painting , [93] and Tamil architecture were developed and continue to be practised in Tamil Nadu. [94] Literature [ edit ] 

Tamil written literature has existed for over 2000 years. [95] The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature , is dated from ca. 300 BC – AD 300. [96] [97] It is the oldest Indian literature amongst all others. [98] The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BC. [99] [100] 

Most early Tamil literary works are in verse form, with prose not becoming more common until later periods. The Sangam literature collection contains 2381 poems composed by 473 poets, some 102 of whom remain anonymous. [101] Sangam literature is primarily secular, dealing with everyday themes in a Tamilakam context. [102] The Sangam literature also deals with human relationship and emotions. [103] The available literature from this period was categorised and compiled in the 10th century into two categories based roughly on chronology. The categories are: Pathinenmaelkanakku ( The Major Eighteen Anthology Series ) comprising Eṭṭuttokai ( The Eight Anthologies ) and the Pattupattu ( Ten Idylls ) and Pathinenkilkanakku ( The Minor Eighteen Anthology Series ). 

Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the Tolkāppiyam . Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 1000 B.C grammar Naṉṉūl which restated and clarified the rules of the Tolkāppiyam , with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu , sol , poruḷ , yāppu , aṇi . Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry. [104] Notable example of Tamil poetry include the Tirukkural written by Tiruvalluvar before 2000 years. 

In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam', thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. [105] Tamil Lexicon , published by the University of Madras , is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language. [106] During the Indian freedom struggle , many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, social equity and secularist thoughts among the common man, notably Subramanya Bharathy and Bharathidasan .

Pongal , also called as Tamizhar Thirunaal (festival of Tamils) or Makara Sankranti elsewhere in India, a four-day harvest festival is one of the most widely celebrated festivals throughout Tamil Nadu. [107] The Tamil language saying Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum – literally meaning, the birth of the month of Thai will pave way for new opportunities – is often quoted with reference to this festival. The first day, Bhogi Pongal, is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials by setting them on fire to mark the end of the old and emergence of the new. The second day, Surya Pongal, is the main day which falls on the first day of the tenth Tamil month Thai (14 January or 15 January in western calendar). The third day, Maattu Pongal, is meant to offer thanks to the cattle, as they provide milk and are used to plough the lands. Jallikattu , a bull taming contest, marks the main event of this day. Alanganallur is famous for its Jallikattu [108] [109] contest usually held on 3rd day of Pongal. During this final day, Kaanum Pongal – the word "kaanum", means 'to view' in Tamil. In 2011 the Madras High Court Bench ordered the cockfight at Santhapadi and Modakoor Melbegam villages permitted during the Pongal festival while disposing of a petition filed attempting to ban the cockfight. [110] The first month in the Tamil calendar is Chittirai and the first day of this month in mid-April is celebrated as Tamil New Year .

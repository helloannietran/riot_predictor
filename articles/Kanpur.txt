Kanpur ( / ˈ k ɑː n p ʊər / pronunciation ( help · info ) ; formerly Cawnpore ; is the 12th most populous city in India . It is the administrative headquarters of Kanpur Nagar district and Kanpur division . It is the second largest industrial town in north India, following Delhi . 

The name is believed to have derived from Karnapur (meaning "town of Karna", one of the heroes of the Mahabharata ). Another theory is that it came from the nearby town of Makanpur , earlier known as Khairabad, where the Sufi saint of the Madariya Sufi order , Badiuddin Zinda Shah Madar, settled. [5]

History Kanpur Sangrahalaya 

In 1207, Raja Kanh Deo of the Kanhpuria clan established the village of Kanhpur, which later came to be known as Kanpur. [6] [7] 1857 uprising Main article: Siege of Cawnpore 

In the 19th century, Kanpur was an important British garrison with barracks for 7,000 soldiers. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , 900 British men, women and children were besieged in the fortifications for 22 days by rebels under Nana Sahib Peshwa . They surrendered on the agreement that they would get safe passage to the nearby Satti Chaura Ghat whereupon they would board barges and be allowed to go by river to Allahabad . [8] 

Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened at the Satti Chaura Ghat , and who fired the first shot, it is known that, soon afterwards, the departing British were shot at by the rebel sepoys and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the rebels had, on purpose, placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the English. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satti Chaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come. [9] 

Many were killed and the remaining 200 British women and children were brought back to shore and sent to a building called the Bibighar (the ladies' home). After some time, the commanders of the rebels decided to kill their hostages. The rebel soldiers refused to carry out orders and butchers from the nearby town were brought in to kill the hostages three days before the British entered the city on 18 July. The dismembered bodies were thrown into a deep well nearby. The British under General Neill retook the city and committed a series of retaliations against the rebel Sepoys and those civilians caught in the area, including women, children and old men. The Kanpur Massacre, as well as similar events elsewhere, were seen by the British as justification for unrestrained vengeance. [10]
